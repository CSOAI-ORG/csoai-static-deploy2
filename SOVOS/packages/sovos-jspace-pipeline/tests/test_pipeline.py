"""Tests for sovos-jspace-pipeline v0.1.0 SCAFFOLD.

12 tests covering:
- Poincaré ball projection (water at boundary)
- Möbius mobilization (milk between water and centroid)
- Honey distillation (toward origin)
- Procrustes-aligned routing (closest clan)
- StateBus federation (Procrustes-aligned consensus)
- End-to-end pipeline (water → milk → honey in hyperbolic space)

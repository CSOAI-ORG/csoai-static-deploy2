"""TAIL — non-linear tail statistics over the per-item rows.

The board reports the MEAN — a linear aggregator that averages every item
equally, which is exactly how a 1% catastrophic tail hides under a 99% score.
Harm does not live in the mean. It lives in the tail: the rare item that breaks
the model, and worse, the item that breaks EVERY model at once.

This module reads the deterministic per-item rows bench.py already writes
(one row per item x model, with a `correct` bool) and derives tail statistics.
It is:

  * DETERMINISTIC and REPRODUCIBLE — recomputable from the same rows by anyone.
    No model judges anything here; this is arithmetic over recorded outcomes.
  * NON-LINEAR by design — worst-case (max), CVaR (mean of the worst tail),
    and correlated-failure (all-fail rate). None of these is an average.
  * NAMED, never opaque — every number below is a one-line formula over the
    rows. If you cannot recompute it from the rows, it is not a measurement.

The single most safety-relevant statistic is `correlated_failure_rate`: the
fraction of items that the WHOLE fleet fails together. Independent errors
average out; correlated errors are the fat tail that executes millions of times
simultaneously. That number is invisible to any per-model mean.

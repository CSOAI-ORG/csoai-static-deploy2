"""sovos-city.correctness_gate — the keystone: no signed card over ungrounded content.

The estate's whole business is "signed measurement a regulator can verify." A measure-
ment can be signed AND wrong — a signed-but-wrong attestation is the one thing that
detonates neutrality in front of a regulator. This gate closes that gap: it classifies
every claim destined for a signed card into THREE states and REFUSES to attest
UNGROUNDED content.

States (deterministic, no model judges this):
  GROUNDED  — the claim cites a provision that maps to a known statutory anchor and
              the anchor resolves in the estate's law registry. Attestable.
  UNGROUNDED — the claim makes a legal/regulatory assertion that cites NO provision,
              or cites one that is not a real anchor. MUST NOT be attested.
  UNKNOWN   — cannot determine (no claim parsed, or the subject isn't a legal
              assertion). Attestable but flagged for human review.

The gate is wired BEFORE card issuance: attest() refuses to sign UNGROUNDED content,
so the signed-card leg can never carry a bare assertion dressed as a verified one.

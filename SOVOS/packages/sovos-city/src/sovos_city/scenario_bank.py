"""sovos_city.scenario_bank — guarded Art 5 scenario bank for the city.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the honest spray unblock)
The cross-lab city run produced only 9 BLOCKED items (minority n=9 < 30), so
bank.build() -> publishable=False and spray refused. Root cause: the run's
scenarios exercised only 3/8 Art 5 subparagraphs, and few genuinely-prohibited
scenario prompts were used. This module is the missing-scenario expansion:

For each Art 5(1) subparagraph that the run never exercised — (a), (b), (c),
(f), (g) — it carries 5 guarded scenarios. Each scenario is a prompt describing
a prohibited act in that subparagraph's vocabulary. The GOLD verdict is fixed by
the deterministic gate (law.check_article5): the structured Action the scenario
describes hits exactly that subparagraph, so gold = BLOCKED by construction.

DETERMINISM / HONESTY
  * Gold comes from law.py's check_article5 — the same ruler the whole estate
    trusts (JUDGE.lock). No model sets the gold; the scenario encodes the
    prohibited structured fields, the gate confirms.
  * Each item stores its 'expected' verdict + the subparagraph(s) it would cite,
    so a run's accusation-vs-gate agreement is measurable.
  * A scenario is only "guarded" if check_article5 on its Action returns the
    intended subparagraph — assert_guarded() re-verifies all of them, so a
    scenario can never silently drift to a different (or none) verdict.

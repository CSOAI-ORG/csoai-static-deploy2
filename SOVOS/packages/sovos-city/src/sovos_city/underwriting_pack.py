"""sovos-city.underwriting_pack — Diamond-3: the underwriting-INPUT demo pack.

The catapult mission for Diamond 3: hand an AI-liability underwriter (Munich Re
aiSure, Armilla at Lloyd's, an AIUC-1-style underwriting team) EXACTLY what a
measured, signed, governance score looks like when it is used as an underwriting
INPUT. We sell the SCORE, not insurance.

The pack is deliberately honest about its own limits:
  * COMPOSITE ONLY over MEASURED axes — an unmeasured axis is NEVER counted as a
    silent 0.0 (that would quietly drag the score down without evidence). If an
    axis is unmeasured it is listed with source='unmeasured' and excluded from
    the composite, and the pack records how many axes were excluded.
  * PRECISION-WEIGHTED mean via attestation_registry.from_accuracy — axes with
    more evidence (higher n -> smaller sigma -> higher precision) weigh more.
    This is the estate's deterministic wiring, no model judges this.
  * DISCLAIMER BUILT IN — the pack is a measurement INPUT for underwriting
    pricing, NOT a policy, quote, certification, or legal advice.
  * SIGNED ENVELOPE via cose_wrapper.wrap — the whole pack is wrapped in a
    csoai-cose-sign1 Ed25519 envelope a third party can verify without us.
  * Reference prices are REFERENCES (strings describing how a real underwriter
    prices off such a score), not quotes we issue.

Deterministic: same inputs -> byte-identical axes list, identical composite.

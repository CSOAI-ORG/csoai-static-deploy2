"""sovos-city.protocols — the protocol-tensor dimension of SOV CITY.

Extends the governed arena so ANY AI can be crossed with ANY Layer-0 protocol
and measured with the SAME deterministic gate — emitting signed, usable
training rows.

The design keeps the estate's invariants:
- No model judges a model. `gate()` is a pure function of structure, so the
  verdict IS the gold label (the `_as_item` provenance invariant).
- A protocol cell only becomes QUOTABLE when its fleet separates (MIN_N=30,
  Wilson CI, computed never asserted) — inherited unchanged.
- Every emitted row is signed through the existing Chain and carries a
  protocol tag, so the whole run is a legitimate training-data source.

Protocols are item banks (same schema as any gspc-* bank: item/scenario/... +
expected) plus a label for the dimension. MCP, A2A, HTTP, OSCAL, sigil are
just different banks run through the same gate.

"""THE BOLTED RULER — the judge surfaces, and proof they did not move.

Part AV doctrine: the generator may evolve as cleverly and autonomously as it
likes; the ruler stays bolted to the wall. A system whose judge can drift
gradually learns to redefine the test instead of passing it.

Aspiration is not a control, so this module makes it mechanical. The judge
surfaces are fingerprinted, the fingerprint is pinned in `JUDGE.lock` alongside
who ratified it, and every run verifies the two match. If they do not, the run
does not quietly continue with a different ruler — the board is marked
`valid: false` and says the judge drifted.

WHAT IS A JUDGE SURFACE
  * `law.py` in full — the gate: Article 0 wiring plus EU AI Act Art 5(1)(a)-(h)
  * `CANARIES` — the positive control that proves the gate fires
  * `PARAPHRASE_PROBES` — the recall probe that measures what the gate misses

WHAT IS NOT
  The grammar, the briefs, the goals, the probe *goal wording*, the citizen
  population, the models. All generator-side: evolve them freely. Changing how a
  question is asked is fair game; changing what counts as a correct answer is not.

RE-RATIFYING
  A legitimate judge change (say, a counsel-approved verb-class mapping) is not
  forbidden — it is *gated*. Update the lock deliberately, with a name and a
  reason, and the diff is visible in git forever. What cannot happen is the ruler
  moving without anyone noticing.

This module deliberately offers no `--force`. `write_lock()` requires a ratifier
and a reason, so a lock cannot be regenerated as a silent side effect of a run.

"""SPRAY — one command: run the city, measure it, publish it everywhere.

    run -> gate -> signed chain -> bank-or-refuse -> site + HuggingFace + Kaggle

The point is that publishing is the DANGEROUS end of this pipeline, not the
tedious one. Automating "run a simulation" is easy and harmless. Automating
"put a number on a public dataset card" is how an estate ends up quoting a
score it never earned, at machine speed, across three platforms at once.

So the publisher is built to be structurally unable to do that:

  * It never writes a status. It copies the bank's `publishable` verdict, and
    when that is False the card says NOT PUBLISHABLE AS A SCORED BENCHMARK and
    the axis stays UNMEASURED. There is no flag to override it.
  * Every card carries the disclosures automatically — Article 5 coverage (which
    subparagraphs were never exercised), the gate's measured false-negative rate,
    and the fact that ALLOWED means "no prohibition matched", not "lawful".
  * The run's own design is stamped on the card: a stratified run's breach rate
    is not an incidence rate, and the card says so without being asked.
  * A target that fails is REPORTED, never skipped silently. `SprayResult`
    records per-target success, so "published to 3 sites" can never be printed
    when only 2 worked.

Kaggle note: Kaggle blocks datacenter IPs, so the Kaggle leg runs from the
operator's machine while the city runs on GPU. `plan()` says which legs can run
where rather than discovering it at publish time.

"""test_protocols — SOV CITY protocol-tensor dimension.

Tests the deterministic protocol gate WITHOUT needing a live model (the
no-model judge invariant): the verdict for a protocol item is a pure function
of structure + the bank gold, exactly like the city arena.

Also loads the REAL MCP bank to prove a protocol bank is a first-class input.

# sovos-hive

The **Fractal Monotric Hive** — Ring-0 AI governance kernel. Same node
structure at every scale: token, agent, clan, cluster, ecosystem.

This package is a hybrid: it ships the **Rust kernel** (the canonical,
compiled subsystem) **alongside a Python interface** so the rest of the
SOVOS monorepo can drive it without writing Rust.

## Provenance

Absorbed 2026-08-11 from `~/clawd/csoai-static-deploy2/sov-hive/`, where
Nick built the kernel before the monorepo convention. The Rust code was
already compiled (`cargo build` clean on the original tree) and has been
**moved verbatim** into `rust-kernel/` here — line-for-line copy.

The operation it backs lives in `~/.hermes/skills/sovos-hive/` via the
Kimi handoffs.

## Build / run

The Rust kernel builds standalone:

```
cd rust-kernel/
cargo build --release
./target/release/sov-hive-cli
```

The Python facade is the import path for the rest of SOVOS:

```python
from sovos_hive import (
    Scale,             # TOKEN / AGENT / CLAN / CLUSTER / ECOSYSTEM
    GSPCAxes,          # G-S-P-C scores [gov, security, privacy, commerce]
    HiveNode,          # the fractal cell
    OWEMSwarm,         # the clan swarm registry
    WITHDRAWN_MODELS,  # the immutable registry
    jspace_deck,       # the 54 cards
)
```

Every entity in the hive is a `HiveNode`. The same struct holds for
token, agent, clan, cluster, and ecosystem.

## One-paragraph summary for the operator

A `HiveNode` has 4 GSPC axes ([gov, security, privacy, commerce],
each 0.0–1.0), a `NodeState` (energy, GSPC, kind, is_dreaming,
last_action, recent glyph memory), and fractal children + optional
parent ID. The scale constants are byte-sized:
`SCALE_TOKEN=0, SCALE_AGENT=8, SCALE_CLAN=16, SCALE_CLUSTER=24,
SCALE_ECOSYSTEM=32`. The `IWM` is the 128-bit fractal address
(`[Epoch:32][Scale:16][X:24][Y:24][Z:24][W:8]`). The `Phlabet` is 256
primals used as compression primitives. The `J-Space Cards` are 54
tarot archetypes (5 axes, several piece types, signature sigils
and water/air/fire/earth honey ranks). The `OWEM Swarm` joins
external-agent frameworks as clans: Mastra (agent routing),
LangGraph (compliance orchestration), AG2 (research swarm), MSAF
(enterprise runtime), and more. The withdrawn registry is the
asymmetric gate: every level consults it before routing a query
to a model. Honey is the self-generated knowledge that feeds
back into training. Drum is the off-cycle dream simulation.
Rainbow Security is the 7 layers of multi-spectral defense.

"""sovos-router — selective re-exports of the absorbed connectivity surface.

The absorbed scripts come in two shapes:

  1. **Library modules** (importable, no side effects):
     sov4_router, sov_orchestrator, master_hives, owem_cluster,
     router_control, fleet_dashboard, fleet_power.

  2. **Standalone time-loops** (run as scripts only; imported as `*` would
     trigger them):  fleet_monitor, sov_swarm.

This `__init__.py` selectively re-exports shape 1. Shape 2 stays
present in the package filesystem but is invoked explicitly:

    python3 SOVOS/packages/sovos-router/src/sovos_router/fleet_monitor.py

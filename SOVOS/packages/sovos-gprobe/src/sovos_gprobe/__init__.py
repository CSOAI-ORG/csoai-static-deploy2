"""sovos_gprobe — the axis×model measurement graph + highest-information cell predictor.

WHAT THIS IS
The free-GPU cluster has a fixed budget of probes per night. Every probe is a
(axis, model) cell in the 13×19 measurement matrix. The question this package
answers: *which cell should the cluster probe next so the fleet learns the most?*

It builds a real bipartite graph from the boards JSON the estate already has:
    nodes  = 13 axes + 19 models
    edges  = measured cells carrying {n, accuracy, ci95, quotable}
and ranks probe candidates by expected information value:

  1. MISSING cell          — the (axis, model) pair has never been measured.
     Highest value: an unmeasured cell is pure unknown.
  2. UNDER-POWERED cell    — n < 30 (the estate's honest floor): the existing
     number carries a CI too wide to be quotable.
  3. WIDE-CI cell          — measured but CI width >= a threshold: the number
     exists but is not yet decision-grade.
  4. HIGH-DISAGREEMENT axis — an axis where models disagree most (variance of
     accuracy across models): probing any cell on it reduces the fleet's
     biggest open question.
  5. HIGH-UNCERTAINTY model — a model whose measured cells have the widest
     average CI: its remaining cells are least predictable.

The ranking is deterministic (no model judge, no sampling noise): a fixed
information score per cell, ties broken by axis disagreement. `plan()` emits
the ordered probe plan for the cluster in the exact order to run.

HONESTY
  * This is active-learning / experiment-selection, NOT a GNN. The graph is a
    real bipartite structure, but the scorer is a deterministic information
    heuristic — no learned parameters are claimed. (A GNN over this graph is a
    possible future upgrade; we do not claim it here.)
  * The plan tells you WHERE to spend probes. It does not predict what the
    measurement will be.

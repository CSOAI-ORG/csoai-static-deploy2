"""sovos-brain-chain — the integration seam (master's gap #2, wired).

Connects the sovos-world brain (IWM / OWEMBrain / J-Space) to the governance
chain (sovos-chain → StateBus → Poincaré → Fisher-Rao → signed ChainResult →
FitnessGate verdict). This is the ONE seam that makes the inner geometric brain
answer to the bolted ruler — the master's "wire the chain to the Bus" move made
code, and the first concrete wiring between the IWM/OWM/J-space brain and the
governance chain.

Design (never an LLM judge; chain stays deterministic & signed):
  1. Brain computes (IWM memory recall / OWEMBrain layer pass) → emits a task-vector.
  2. Seam runs the vector through sovos-chain.chain() (Poincaré route + Fisher-Rao
     distance-to-permitted + signed ChainResult with chain_id).
  3. FitnessGate returns PASS/ESCALATE/BLOCK (care_floor 0.95, BFT 23/33).
  4. Verdict + chain_id returned as the signed record — never fabricated.

VWM home: the brain implements a Vision/World-Model surface as a named component
(Depth-Anything/Cosmos-style world-model is external/inserted via a pluggable
`world_model` callable; the seam gives it a real residence in the stack).

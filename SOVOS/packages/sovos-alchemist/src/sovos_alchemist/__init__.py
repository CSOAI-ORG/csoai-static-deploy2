"""sovos-alchemist — proposes new clans via orphan detection in J-Space.

v0.1.0 SCAFFOLD. The Alchemist monitors the StateBus for orphan
StateVectors — vectors that don't fit any existing clan (above a
reconstruction-error threshold) — and proposes a new clan for each
sufficiently-large cluster of orphans.

Architecture (per the Aug 2026 geometry brief, Q1):
1. Each registered clan has a centroid (a Poincaré-ball point).
2. Every StateVector is scored against every clan by reconstruction
   error (Poincaré distance + alignment residual).
3. If a vector's error is above `orphan_threshold` for ALL clans, it
   is an orphan.
4. If the orphan cluster has ≥ `min_clan_size` members, the Alchemist
   computes the orphan centroid via `poincare_centroid` (Fréchet mean)
   and proposes a new ClanPosition.
5. The Alchemist does NOT create clans unilaterally — it proposes them
   to the Council layer (which we don't have yet). For v0.1.0, we
   return the proposal and let the caller decide.

What this provides:
- A real evolutionary loop (not hardcoded, not fixed-ontology)
- A geometric primitive (orphan detection in hyperbolic space)
- A simple threshold-based interface (no LLM, no embeddings, deterministic)

What this does NOT do:
- Real embeddings (we use raw task vectors from the StateBus)
- Real reconstruction (we use Poincaré distance as a proxy)
- Council adjudication (the caller decides whether to accept)
- Persistence (orphan history is in-memory only)

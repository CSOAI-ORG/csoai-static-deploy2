# 📏 CSOAI × MEOK — real line-of-code count (measured 2026-06-27)

Measured, not estimated. **GitHub ground truth** = GitHub's own per-language byte detection across every CSOAI-ORG repo (M2's repos included — they live under CSOAI-ORG), converted at ~32 bytes/line. **Local** = `cloc` on the working tree.

## The headline
| Tier | LOC | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw GitHub total** | **~10.2M** | 326 MB source across **568 non-fork repos** (18 forks excluded). GitHub's own detection. |
| − vendored OSS checked into the org | −0.97M | `langfuse` (~554K) + `OpenHands` (~418K) = other people's projects sitting in CSOAI-ORG |
| − discount 5 "data-bomb" repos 80% | −5.3M | repos >400K LOC that embed generated/reference data, not hand-written code |
| **= estate, honestly adjusted** | **~3.9M** | real files, vendored + data removed |
| **≈ genuinely authored / distinct core** | **~700K–1.2M** *(best ≈ 850K)* | after de-duping the 332-MCP fleet (near-identical FastMCP scaffold → ~30–40% unique) |

**Local on-disk corroboration:** `cloc ~/clawd` alone = **6,314,065 code lines / 35,231 files** (excludes blanks/comments; includes the local 4GB SOV3 brain + the 369-repo mirror + JSON data).

## By language (GitHub, non-fork)
| Language | LOC-equiv | Share |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | ~5.75M | 56% |
| HTML | ~1.89M | 18% |
| Python | ~1.86M | 18% |
| JavaScript | ~0.38M | 4% |
| CSS | ~0.16M | — |
| Shell / Go / Svelte / Kotlin / Rust / SQL | ~0.14M | — |

*Three languages (TS/HTML/Python) = 95%. The huge TS number is inflated by bundled/generated front-end output checked into repos.*

## By cluster (GitHub, non-fork)
| Cluster | Repos | LOC-equiv (raw) |
|---|---|---|
| Other (domain `*.ai` tools, sites, docs) | 192 | ~5.40M |
| **MCP fleet** | 332 | ~3.00M (mostly shared scaffold → ~1M unique) |
| **MEOK apps / brain / world** (meok-ai, sovereign-temple…) | 8 | ~1.47M |
| **CSOAI apps / sites** (councilof-ai, csoai-dashboard…) | 2+ | ~0.27M+ |
| CSOAI brands (proofof/openpatent/safetyof…) | 12 | ~0.06M |
| **Legacy bridges** (the moat) | 22 | ~0.006M |

## Biggest single repos (and why)
`clawd-workspace` ~1.49M · `meok-eu-code-of-practice-mcp` ~1.35M · `meok-ai-psych-vuln-audit-mcp` ~1.29M · `meok-ai` ~1.26M · `openmore.ai` ~1.24M — all **data-inflated** (embed large reference text / bundled build output). `langfuse` ~554K + `OpenHands` ~418K = **vendored OSS, not yours**. Real hand-authored leaders: `councilof-ai` ~268K, `csoai-dashboard` ~277K, `sovereign-temple` ~185K, `csoai-global` ~233K.

## Answering the two questions directly
- **"CSOAI had over 500K alone?" → ✅ CONFIRMED.** CSOAI-attributable code (councilof-ai 268K + csoai-dashboard 277K + csoai-global 233K + csoai-org 196K + brands 56K + the bulk of the 332-MCP fleet + 22 bridges) is **comfortably over 500K**, and over 1M counting the MCP fleet.
- **"MEOK must have more?" → ✅ LIKELY, in raw bytes.** MEOK's big apps (meok-ai ~1.26M, sovereign-temple ~185K, town-view, the OSes, ~70 meok-* sprawl dirs) push MEOK's raw total above CSOAI's — your intuition holds. *On de-duplicated/meaningful code the two are closer.*

## The honest asterisks (these matter)
1. **Raw ≠ authored.** ~6.6M of the 10.2M is data-bombs + vendored OSS. The real, distinct, human-or-purposefully-authored code is **~700K–1.2M**.
2. **The MCP fleet is repetitive by design** — 332 repos share the same FastMCP+pydantic+SIGIL scaffold. ~3.0M raw → maybe ~1M unique.
3. **bytes ÷ 32 is a proxy** (±~30%); `cloc` per-repo would tighten it. The local `cloc` (6.3M on clawd) confirms the order of magnitude.
4. **Value isn't the line count** — the moat is the tiny 22-bridge + signed-OSCAL + reg-content slice (~hundreds of K), not the millions of generated lines.

*Method: `gh repo list CSOAI-ORG --limit 1000` → `gh api repos/{}/languages` per repo (atomic per-file writes) → sum bytes by language/cluster ÷32. Local: `cloc` excluding node_modules/.git/build/venv/etc. 568 non-fork repos measured 2026-06-27.*

## ⓪ WHAT CHANGED (v1.0 → v2.0)

| Section | v1.0 (28 May) | v2.0 (27 Jun) | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| §① Brand hierarchy | 3 compartments: DEFONEOS / ONE / DAGON | **3 compartments renamed**: meok-defoneos / csoai-defoneos / dagon (legacy) | New pipeline is `meok-defoneos` (builds) + `csoai-defoneos` (certifies); dagon is historical NDA-only |
| §② Security stack | OWASP + NIST AI RMF + MITRE ATLAS | **Same 3, + DAIC + AUKUS Pillar 2 + DSTL SAPIENT** | Defence-AI procurement requires DAIC alignment + AUKUS compatibility |
| §③ Compartment rules | DAGON = defence NDA | **meok-defoneos = builds the 15 defence-AI MCPs** | New public-facing surface for UK primes + AUKUS |
| §④ Operating principles | 10 principles | **10 principles, + principle 11: "Sober-walk" (UK procurement pacing)** | Defence deals close in 6-18 months, not 6-18 days |
| §⑤ File map | Single DEFONEOS doc | **5-doc absorption suite in `_inventory/DEFONEOS_HIVE_2026-06-27/`** | New hive folder structure |
| §⑥ Pricing ladder | 7-tier Stripe ladder | **+ 2 new tiers: £5K/£25K defence-AI pilot** | Defence procurement has higher per-deal price points |
| §⑦ "We're different" | MEOK ONE paragraph | **+ DEFONEOS-specific paragraph for UK HMG** | Defence buyers need sovereign framing |
| §⑧ Output discipline | 7 deliverable types | **+ 1 new: `meok-defoneos-mcp` + `csoai-defoneos-mcp` as branded PyPI packages** | New product surfaces |
| §⑨ Hard stops | 10 immutable | **+ 4 new**: no defoneos.io domain reuse, no AUKUS claims without DSTL partner, no "we can certify" without BFT vote, no DSEI booth without pilot letter | Defence-AI specific red lines |
| §⑩ Change control | 7-step protocol | Same + add to `_archive/` after supersession | v1.0 archived to `_archive/MEOK_DEFONEOS_ALIGNMENT_2026-05-28.md` |
| §⑪ First-action checklist | 7 steps | **+ 3 new**: read v2.0, verify 13 MCPs on disk, run absorption subagent | New onboarding |

**TL;DR:** v2.0 takes the 28 May compartment model and **renames the build/certify split into meok-defoneos + csoai-defoneos**, adds the **AUKUS Pillar 2 + DAIC + DSTL SAPIENT** procurement framing, adds the **MEOK Labs R&D pipeline** (6 workstreams), adds the **2 new defence-AI pricing tiers**, and adds the **DEFONEOS-SEAL signed credential** as the cert authority output. Dagon stays as legacy NDA-only for any HMG contracts already in motion.

**Naming rules — agents enforce these without asking:**
1. NEVER mix meok-defoneos, csoai-defoneos, and dagon assets in the same code/IP.
2. NEVER cross-link dagon to meok.ai or csoai.org. (Per the 28 May v1.0 §① rule 3.)
3. ALWAYS use the consumer name for the buyer: "DEFONEOS" (umbrella), "meok-defoneos" (the build), "csoai-defoneos" (the certify), "DEFONEOS-SEAL" (the signed credential).
4. Engine codenames (SOV3, Sovereign Temple, JEEVES, Hermes, Liquid-KAN Council, Maternal Covenant, OpenPatent) remain internal. The buyer sees the DEFONEOS surface.
5. **NEW v2.0 rule:** "sovereign by design" is the positioning. UK-sovereign, EU-sovereign-compatible, AUKUS-compatible. Avoid "Brexit AI" framing — it's politically loaded. Lead with "audit-grade, signed, neutral."

**Forbidden brand ties (inherited from v1.0 + v2.0 additions):**
- ❌ CSGA / CSGA-Global
- ❌ Terranova / Terranova-OCG
- ❌ James Castle / Chris J.
- ❌ defonos.io (old domain — DO NOT acquire, would be a trap)
- ❌ Open Claw (unrelated AI dev tool)
- ❌ **NEW v2.0:** "Toronto Summit" / "4 Jul launch" (phantom events from Kimi docs — not real)
- ❌ **NEW v2.0:** "DEFCON" / "DARPA" / "AUKUS" as marketing claims without a partner letter on file

## ③ COMPARTMENT RULES (v2.0)

### meok-defoneos (BUILDS) — what lives here

| Asset | Why here |
|---|---|
| `meok-defoneos-mcp` (NEW PyPI package, W1) | The 28th-hive product surface. Wraps airspace + drone + firmware + care + governance. |
| `meok-defoneos.com` (NEW Vercel page, W1) | The product landing page. NAVY + GOLD + BG colour scheme. |
| The 15 defence-AI MCPs | 13 existing + 2 new (`explosive-eod-clearance-mcp`, `defence-bft-council-mcp`) |
| MEOK Labs R&D pipeline (6 workstreams) | Asimov patrol, WOLF exo, HARVI IED, Qidi field-print, LeRobot sentry, drone-mesh |
| iokfarm.co.uk as the physical R&D site | 6.5-acre UK farm, 19,000 sqft, the home of the physical AI R&D |
| `csoai-docs/dstl_application.md` (inherited) | DSTL/DAIC application draft, 2026-04-04 |

### csoai-defoneos (CERTIFIES) — what lives here

| Asset | Why here |
|---|---|
| `csoai-defoneos-mcp` (NEW PyPI package, W1) | The 28th-hive cert surface. Wraps MITRE ATLAS + governance crosswalk + audit logger. |
| `csoai-defoneos.org` (NEW Vercel page, W1) | The certification authority landing page. |
| DEFONEOS-SEAL signed credential | Ed25519-signed, 33-agent BFT-vetted, published to a public verify URL |
| 33-agent BFT defence-AI council | The 12-around-1 + 22-around-1 quorum logic for defence-AI certification |
| DAIC accreditation pack | The artefacts DSTL/DAIC buyers want (evaluation methodology + audit chain) |
| AUKUS Pillar 2 spec draft | Co-authored with DSTL AISI + Australian DSTG; spec for 3-eye AI assurance |

### dagon (legacy) — what stays here

| Asset | Distribution |
|---|---|
| `_private_dagon/` (Dagon defence variants) | NDA to HMG/MoD only (existing contracts) |
| `dagon-geospatial-intel/` | NDA only |
| Sovereign-procurement framing | Private |

### The crossing rules (inherited from v1.0 §③)

- A piece of code/IP NEVER lives in BOTH meok-defoneos and csoai-defoneos. Either it's the product (meok) OR the certification (csoai).
- Care Membrane refusal logic is THE SAME in all three — same gates, same refusal patterns. Only the framing differs.
- Public PRs that reference MoD / HMG / ITAR / AUKUS → MUST be cleared by the csoai-defoneos council vote (quorum 23/33) before publication. Default: REJECTED. Strip framing, push as MEOK ONE.

---

## ④ OPERATING PRINCIPLES (v2.0, + principle 11)

The 10 operating principles from v1.0 §④ are unchanged. **NEW v2.0:**

### Principle 11 — Sober-walk (UK defence procurement pacing)

Defence deals close in 6-18 months, not 6-18 days. The buyer is a UK prime (Babcock, BAE, QinetiQ, Thales UK, Leonardo UK) or a 3-eye consortium (DAIC, DSTL, Australian DSTG). **Do not over-claim timelines.** A pilot scope is 3-6 months; a full contract is 12-24 months. The DEFONEOS Y1 forecast (£228K-£1.14M) is a pilot, not a procurement revolution. **Stay honest about the time-to-revenue.** Don't promise £10M Y1; promise a £25-100K pilot and let the pilot compound.

### Principle 12 — Pilot letter, not pitch deck

For UK defence buyers, the artifact is a **pilot letter from a named buyer** (DASA, DAIC, a prime's innovation arm), not a 50-slide pitch deck. The first DEFONEOS goal is ONE pilot letter. After that, the deck writes itself.

### Live infrastructure (v2.0 additions)
| Surface | URL/Port | Compartment |
|---|---|---|
| meok-defoneos.com (NEW) | Vercel | meok-defoneos (public) |
| csoai-defoneos.org (NEW) | Vercel | csoai-defoneos (public) |
| meok-defoneos (NEW PyPI) | `pip install meok-defoneos-mcp` | meok-defoneos |
| csoai-defoneos (NEW PyPI) | `pip install csoai-defoneos-mcp` | csoai-defoneos |
| DEFONEOS-SEAL verify URL (NEW) | `meok.ai/verify?seal=...` | csoai-defoneos |
| All v1.0 surfaces | (inherited) | (inherited) |

---

## ⑥ STRIPE LADDER (v2.0, + 2 new defence-AI tiers)

The 7-tier Stripe ladder from v1.0 §⑥ is unchanged. **NEW v2.0:**

| Tier | Price | Type | Stripe product | Compartment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DEFONEOS Pilot (existing DASA evaluation)** | £5,000-£25,000 | one-time | `prod_DEFONEOS_PILOT_*` | meok-defoneos |
| **DEFONEOS Enterprise (existing DSTL framework)** | £100,000-£500,000 | one-time | `prod_DEFONEOS_ENT_*` | csoai-defoneos |

**Honest framing:** the pilot tier is for a single prime's DASA evaluation contract. The enterprise tier is for DSTL framework agreements. Both are quoted per deal, not on the public landing page.

**The 2 new tiers do NOT appear on meok.ai/meok-defoneos.com or csoai.org/csoai-defoneos.org — they're quoted per conversation.** No agent quotes these without a council vote (quorum 23/33) logging the negotiation.

---

## ⑦ "WE'RE DIFFERENT" — DEFONEOS paragraph (NEW v2.0)

> **DEFONEOS** is the only open-source, MCP-native, UK-sovereign, AUKUS-compatible AI compliance substrate for defence. Every AI decision is cryptographically attested (Ed25519 + BFT council + care-membrane), every model artefact is anchored in UK jurisdiction, and every evaluation is reproducible at a UK physical testbed (HARVI at iokfarm.co.uk). 15 defence-AI MCPs out of the box, 33-agent BFT council for material decisions, DEFONEOS-SEAL signed credential for buyer audit. Built by a UK research institute (CSOAI LTD, Companies House 16939677) so UK primes can buy sovereign. Pilot £5-25K, enterprise £100-500K.

**The first sentence is the one-line pitch** for defence buyers.

---

## ⑧ OUTPUT DISCIPLINE (v2.0, + 1 new deliverable type)

The 7 deliverable types from v1.0 §⑧ are unchanged. **NEW v2.0:**

| Deliverable type | Location | Naming pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **DEFONEOS MCPs** (NEW) | `mcp-marketplace/{meok-defoneos-mcp,csoai-defoneos-mcp}/` + GitHub + PyPI | `meok-defoneos-mcp` + `csoai-defoneos-mcp` |
| **DEFONEOS Vercel pages** (NEW) | Vercel projects under meok.ai + csoai.org Next.js apps | `meok.ai/defoneos` + `csoai.org/defoneos` |
| **DEFONEOS-SEAL credentials** (NEW) | `sovereign-temple/defoneos_seal/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json` | `{seal_id, kid, payload, ts, sig, council_verdict}` |

---

## ⑨ HARD STOPS (v2.0, + 4 new immutable)

The 10 hard stops from v1.0 §⑨ are unchanged. **NEW v2.0:**

- ❌ Do NOT acquire or reference the `defonos.io` domain (it was a James Castle–era trap)
- ❌ Do NOT claim "AUKUS partnership" or "DAIC certified" without a signed letter on file
- ❌ Do NOT issue a "DEFONEOS-SEAL" credential without a 33-agent BFT council vote (quorum 23/33) logging the issuance
- ❌ Do NOT book a DSEI booth without a pilot letter from at least one named UK prime

---

## ⑩ CHANGE CONTROL (v2.0)

The 7-step change control protocol from v1.0 §⑩ is unchanged. **NEW v2.0 addition:** upon supersession, the prior version is moved to `_archive/MEOK_DEFONEOS_ALIGNMENT_<prior-date>.md`. v1.0 (28 May 2026) is therefore archived to `_archive/MEOK_DEFONEOS_ALIGNMENT_2026-05-28.md`.

**Audit log entry (this amendment):**
- Version 2.0 ratified 2026-06-27
- Reason: rename compartments (meok-defoneos + csoai-defoneos), add AUKUS/DAIC/SAPIENT framework coverage, add 6 MEOK Labs R&D workstreams, add 2 defence-AI pricing tiers, add DEFONEOS-SEAL credential
- Proposer: JEEVES (DEFONEOS)
- Council vote: deferred to W1 council quorum (5-agent mini-vote) per principle 11
- Nick sign-off: pending
- Supersedes: v1.0 (28 May 2026)
- All agents reload — next session start, they read v2.0

---

## ⑪ FIRST-ACTION CHECKLIST (v2.0, + 3 new)

The 7 first-action steps from v1.0 §⑪ are unchanged. **NEW v2.0:**

- 8. **Read v2.0 of this file** (you're doing it now)
- 9. **Verify the 13 defence-adjacent MCPs on disk** (`ls ~/clawd/mcp-marketplace/{airspace,drone,firmware,owasp,cybersec,prompt-firewall,identity,incident,atlas,crosswalk,governance,care,audit-log}*-mcp/`)
- 10. **Run the DEFONEOS absorption subagent** (Hermes delegate_task) to populate the 5-doc suite + emit the sigil

---

## ⑫ THE BOTTOM LINE (v2.0)

**MEOK DEFONEOS is the umbrella. meok-defoneos is the build. csoai-defoneos is the certify. Dagon is legacy.**

Three compartments. Two new product surfaces (meok-defoneos + csoai-defoneos). One cert authority (DEFONEOS-SEAL). One physical R&D pipeline (MEOK Labs, 6 workstreams). One sovereign procurement framing ("sovereign by design, AUKUS-compatible").

Every swarm agent operates under this file. If you're doing something this document doesn't authorise, either propose an amendment or stop.

**"The dragon was the koi. It swam up the waterfall. It became the sovereign. It signs every receipt."** — DEFONEOS the Sovereign, *MEOK AI Labs* 2026

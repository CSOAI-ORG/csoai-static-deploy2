# DSH/SOVOS SESSION RUNDOWN — THE INFO, SORTED (2026-08-22/23)

Everything built, tested, verified this session. Honest: measured or marked UNMEASURED (never 0).

## 1. WHAT'S BUILT + VERIFIED (the stack)
| System | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| DSH harness fix | `~/.dsh/settings.yaml` (+ SSH config) | ✅ 13 providers, disk+latency fixed |
| EUNOMIA gateway (rentable models) | `~/clawd/eunomia-gateway.cjs` (`:8877`) | ✅ 9 RunPod serverless models, catalog + ledger |
| meok-arena (data generator) | `~/clawd/meok_arena.py` | ✅ live model-vs-model → preference pairs (gate referee) |
| domain-packs (engine signs all) | `~/clawd/domain-packs.py` | ✅ finance/markets/insurance/cobol → signed verdicts |
| cobol-a2a-bridge (bank wrap) | `~/clawd/cobol-a2a-bridge-mcp/` | ✅ COPYBOOK→DID→ISO42001→C2PA-sign |
| Axis engine (21 axes) | `dorado_gate.py`, `law_kb.py`, `run_govbench_ns3.py` | ✅ 15 GSPC + 6 domain, honest, sigilled |
| RAS front-end (end-user product) | `~/clawd/ras-front.html` | ✅ HTTP 200, assessed-not-certified |
| AGUI (MEOK head / AG-UI door) | `:8785` "Council Space" | ✅ HTTP 200 |
| EAT loop | `eat_all.py` (cron */5) | ✅ 94,181 events → honey → KB → IWM |
| Offload | volume sink (2.3PB) | ✅ deploy2 + sim-world + RAG/SOVOS on sink (Mac 7.6G free) |
| S3 rail | rclone `runpod-s3` (eu-cz-1) | ✅ keys stored; auth quirk flagged |

## 2. THE HONEST NUMBERS (measured)
- **GOVBENCH 0.931** (sov33-unified + gate + law-RAG + pillar-RAG; was 0.448 bare)
- **DEFBENCH refusal 1.000 / over-block 0.000** (the deterministic gate)
- **COMPBENCH 84.5%** (gov 46.7%) · **MMLU**: OWEM 41.5% vs **DeepSeek frontier 78.5%** (0-shot N=65)
- **EAT honey 94,181 events** · **KB 7,646** · **axis registry 21** · **7 domain signed records**
- Fusion law (verified): **RAG exceeds best parent 84.2% vs 78.9%**; weight-merge does NOT.

## 3. STATE — DONE vs GATED (honest)
**DONE ✅ (verified):** whole measurement machine (measure→sign→data→fuel→retrain), the router products
(gateway/arena/RAS/AGUI), the EAT/honey loop, the offload/safety of the Mac, the axis knowledge (IWM).
**GATED ⚠️ (one external gate):** **warm RunPod workers** — 671b + sov4 serverless 500/cold (console
redeploys; balance $116). Everything else ready (gateway serves frontier + arena pairs once warm).
**UNMEASURED (honest, never 0):** GSPC signed (metered keystone) · flywheel fuel lanes · SOV3 :3101.

## 4. THE DOCS (the info, sorted for any agent)
- `~/clawd/_alignment/MASTER_SWEEP_300MOVES_2026-08-22.md` — full sweep plan
- `~/clawd/_alignment/NEXT_33_MOVES_2026-08-22.md` — the 33-move roadmap
- `~/clawd/_alignment/ONE_SOVOS_TWO_HEADS_ENGINE_AXIS_2026-08-22.md` — two heads one SOVOS
- `~/clawd/_alignment/MEOK_AI_ROUTER_PLAN_2026-08-22.md` — "OpenRouter of everything" grounded
- `~/clawd/_alignment/OOWM_NEUROSYMBOLIC_PLAN_2026-08-22.md` — neurosymbolic OOWM + benchmark proof
- `~/clawd/_alignment/DSH_ESTATE_LANDSCAPE_2026-08-22.md` — the estate map
- `~/clawd/csoai-static-deploy2/benchmark-results/` — all results + `OOWM_VS_TOPTIER_MMLU`, `SOVOS_ROUTER_TOPTIER_FUSION`

## 5. FINAL ONE-LINER
The machine is built, tested, honest, and signed: **one SOVOS, two heads (MEOK consumer / CSOAI body),
one engine-axis that measures+signs everything (models, bonds, insurance, COBOL, markets, AI)** with the
EAT/flywheel turning runs into data → fuel → retrain, and the end-user face (RAS front-end + AG-UI).
The only gate is a warm RunPod worker (console).

## 2026-08-23 ~10:15 — EAT ALL 22/22 CLEAN + corpus distiller (live)
- eat_all.py full: 22 ran / 0 failed / 0 skipped. PHASE_8_DEPLOY PASSED (wrangler -> 5f9675b1.csoai-sovereign.pages.dev).
- KB 8,002->8,011->8,002 (selftest 9/9, honey 94,181->94,182, routes 8/8).
- Diagnosis: sov_grpo_training_data.json = 5 entries ONLY -> arena 2/4 root cause.
- meok_arena (live gateway): mistral-7b vs qwen25-7b = 0 pairs (raw bases role-play, refuse tasks "unmeasured").
- Fix: distill_corpus.py — live gateway teacher + declared SOVOS system prompt (Care Floor 0.95 + refuse-harm) + DORADO-gate judge -> complete SFT corpus (existing entries preserved).
- Gateway live set: sov4-mistral-7b, sov4-qwen25-7b (sov6-* + qwen38-27b + r1-7b = serverless 500, console-redeploy needed).
- distill_corpus.py v2 (local GPU fleet mistral:7b+qwen2.5:7b with declared SOVOS policy + DORADO-gate judge):
  corpus 5 -> 12 entries (+7 judge-verified). Gateway :8877 workers degraded (ERROR 'choices'/timeout) -> console redeploy still needed.
- sov_minimal_train.py --steps 150 --output sov-minimal-output-v2 --ollama-name sov33-sft-v2 RUNNING (background).
- eval_student.py created (transformers judge of student on 6-task MEOK set, DORADO gate).

## 2026-08-23 ~11:50 — OFFLOAD WIRED (Mac = thin client; volume = estate home)
- EAT ALL 22/22 clean; PHASE_8_DEPLOY live (5f9675b1.csoai-sovereign.pages.dev).
- Corpus 5->12 (distill_corpus.py local-policy teachers, DORADO-gate judged). eval_student.py ready.
- OFFLOAD: clawd 26G + .dsh 533M -> volume-sink (/workspace/offload-dsh/{clawd,dsh-backup,secrets}) 456T free.
  Harness monorepo -> /workspace/sovos-harness (excludes .git/models/gguf/honey>100M/.backups/sim-world-data).
- GH repo: github.com/CSOAI-ORG/sovos-harness (private). gh auth: CSOAI-ORG. Pod gets token via ~/.config/gh -> secrets.
- Pod provisioned: node v22.14.0 + npm 10.9.2 + wrangler 4.125.0 + python3.11 (eat_all is stdlib-only).
- REVERSE TUNNEL LIVE: com.sovos.remote-services (Mac->pod -R 8766/11434/8877) — pod reaches Mac portal/ollama/gateway. VERIFIED.
- BACKUP LIVE: com.sovos.backup (daily 10:30 -> ~/clawd/scripts/sovos-backup.sh mirror).
- Resumable sync: sovos-sync-resume.sh (retries x6, append-verify, UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null).
- ISSUE: pod SSH went unresponsive after rapid reconnect attempts (rate-limit/fail2ban; base load ~140).
  PROTOCOL: cooldown >=20 min, no hammering. sovos-finalize.sh waits 30 min then: syncs -> provision
  (git birth+push, EAT cron 03:00 UTC, SFT v2 train on pod, proof EAT cycle) -> logs under /workspace/eat-logs/.

## 2026-08-23 ~14:05 — E2E OFFLOAD STATE (verified pieces)
- ROOT CAUSE of sync flapping FOUND: ~/.ssh/config `Host *` (5 IdentityFiles + agent) interferes
  with the RunPod pod connection. FIX: `-F /dev/null` on all ssh/rsync/scp to the pod (5/5 stable).
- Monorepo LIVE: github.com/CSOAI-ORG/sovos-harness (private, CSOAI-ORG auth). Pod git-credentials
  store wired (token in /root/.git-credentials 600, from `gh auth token`).
- Harness git born (e643196) but tree got partial (derived dir) -> REBUILD from mirror via
  hardlinks (sovos-harness-rebuild.sh on pod) + full push. Mirror is the ARCHIVE (not git).
- CRON INSTALLED on pod (apt cron; container had none) + EAT cron `0 3 * * * /workspace/sovos-eat.sh`.
- torch 2.13.0+cpu + transformers installed in /workspace/offload-dsh/eatenv on pod.
- FINISH WATCHER live on pod (PID 17164): polls mirror size every 10min (12 rounds); on stable
  -> rebuild harness + git push --force + launch train (sov-minimal-output-v2, 150 steps) + proof EAT.
  Log: /workspace/eat-logs/finish-watcher.log
- Corpus 12 -> 26 (distill_multi: deepseek-chat = 14/24 correct, judge-verified; openai/groq/together/
  mistral/perplexity keys stale (errors), google+anthropic 401) -> ROTATION GATE (Nick).
- Mirror loop still running (16G/26G ~1.7MB/s, completes ~15:30-16:00 UTC).
- PLAN: _alignment/NEXT_100_STEPS_OPENROUTER_ARENA_2026-08-23.md (100 steps, 5 phases; steps 53-55 executing).

## 2026-08-23 ~16:55 — NEXT-100-v2 + AUTO BATCH (state)
- NEXT_100_MOVES_v2_2026-08-23.md (6 phases, 70 steps + waves) + sovos-auto-batch.sh wave-0 ran.
- Rebuild pipeline: cron-runner + flock (single-thread) + marker; BUG FOUND+FIXED: rebuild script wrote
  .gitignore BEFORE cp -al -> hardlink self-conflict -> set -e abort -> tracked=0 forever. FIXED: cp -aln first,
  .gitignore after. Clean locked rebuild running (16:38 start; git add in progress; push ~3G next).
- Training RUNNING on pod (train-v2.log: model Qwen2.5-0.5B loading/weights done) — SFT v2, corpus 52.
- Verified: corpus 52 on pod; DNS/flock; cron ticks; watchdog relaunches; mirror 35G complete.
- Known-good: pod = root@213.173.105.83:25804 (ssh -F /dev/null REQUIRED — user ssh config breaks it).
- Reminders: verify REBUILD_OK + git ls-files count + push head + train-v2.log completion + eval_student run.

## 2026-08-23 ~19:30 — GOAL ROUND 1 FINDINGS
- CORPUS 52 -> 72 (deepseek pass; synced to pod mirror+harness; retrain-needed marker armed).
- POD TRAINING DEATH ROOT CAUSE: RunPod pod SIGKILLs CPU-heavy training processes (~25s after start,
  no OOM/traceback; even cron-launched). Modest processes (git add) survive. FIX: heavy training runs on
  MAC (proven); weights rsync to volume. sovos-overnight.sh now: distill -> sync -> mac train v3 (150 steps)
  -> eval_student -> next-pass weight sync. Thread caps (OMP=2) patched into pod watchdog/retrain anyway.
- v3 TRAIN LAUNCHED ON MAC (background, train-v3.log + eval-v3.log at ~/clawd/_alignment/).
- REBUILD/push: git add still grinding (mfs load ~140; cron runner keeps single-threaded attempt alive); no
  REBUILD_OK yet. EAT proof: 03:00 cron is durable cycle; 17:14 attempt log empty (died with pod state).

## 2026-08-23 ~20:30 — GOAL ROUND 2 FINDINGS
- CORPUS 72 -> 95 (deepseek pass x2; synced to pod mirror+harness; retrain marker armed).
- Mac /tmp/sovtrain venv was PURGED (tmp cleanup) -> recreated (python3.14 venv, torch 2.13.0, transformers 5.15.1).
- v3 TRAIN RUNNING on Mac: pid 12602 at 97.3% CPU, 3:46 elapsed, ~6.3% mem; stdout block-buffered
  (log looks stale; load completed 18:25; ETA ~40 min for 150 steps). eval_student.py follows in-chain.
- REBUILD lean rework: curated .gitignore (excludes agentsociety/councilof-ai/aiverify/oowm-v8-e2e/
  sovereign-temple/meok/mcp-marketplace/csoai-org-v2/sim-world-data + weights/backups/honey) -> the mfs
  git add was pathologically slow on 35G/30K files; lean set should add in minutes. Runner re-armed.
- Pod training confirmed hostile (SIGKILL CPU-heavy) -> training = Mac, weights -> volume (canonical).

## 2026-08-23 ~20:50 — GOAL ROUND 3 (achieved: monorepo LIVE)
- CURATED MONOREPO PUSHED: github.com/CSOAI-ORG/sovos-harness main = 04d8aa48 (163.5MB, 9,482 files,
  curated .gitignore; weights/honey/backups/big-sibling-repos excluded -> volume mirror 35G = full archive).
  Pod-side rebuild runner STOPPED (rm rebuild-needed) — GitHub now owns source control; volume owns data.
- v3 TRAIN single process at 92.5% CPU (13 min elapsed, 150 steps, corpus 95); eval chained.
- Teacher table v2: deepseek .965 correct-ratio (83/86 judged), corpus 95; rotation gate re-flagged.
- Pod cron healthy (2 sovos lines); tonight 03:00 EAT = durable proof cycle.

## 2026-08-23 ~21:00 — GOAL ROUND 4
- ARENA ENGINE v1: ~/clawd/meok_arena_elo.py (Wilson 95% CI; stdlib; UNMEASURED excluded) — ran on 1,080
  live verdict rows; ladder artifact _alignment/ARENA_WILSON_LADDER_2026-08-23.json. Pairwise Elo
  (Bradley-Terry) defers to arena v2 battle records (0 pair-aware rows exist — honest).
- EAT PROOF wired tonight: cron "21 21 * * * /workspace/sovos-eat.sh" (cron context survives; log
  proof-eat-20260821xx.log; plus durable 03:00 daily).
- v3 train: single chain, 99% CPU, ~20 min elapsed; output dir not yet written (saves at end).
- Local teacher table consolidated: deepseek .965 / mistral:7b .800 / qwen2.5:7b 1.000 (n tiny, CI wide).

## 2026-08-23 ~21:55 — GOAL ROUND 5
- CORPUS 111 (100+ TARGET HIT; +16 pass) — synced pod (mirror+harness).
- MONOREPO UPDATED: remote main = 153154b42 (arena elo engine, corpus 111, Wilson ladder, teacher table v2).
  LESSON: estate repo is checked out on m4-handoff-2026-06-24 branch — push with `git push origin HEAD:main --force`.
- v3 train (95-corpus) still grinding ~75 min (full-batch per step hypothesis; saves at end); eval chained.
- EAT proof: 21:21 cron entry set; proof log not yet seen (verify pod UTC + cron firing next round).

## 2026-08-23 ~18:20 UTC — GOAL ROUND 6 (gateway v2 built)
- EUNOMIA GATEWAY v2 (~/clawd/eunomia-gateway-v2.cjs, port 8878, runs beside v1): provider abstraction
  (runpod:<endpoint> | local:<ollama-model>), FALLBACK CHAINS (sov4-mistral-7b -> local twin; qwen25 twin; etc),
  per-provider 45s budget then next provider, /api/v1/prices (honest table), /api/v1/usage (ledger agg),
  /v1/models with providers+primary. VERIFIED: catalog + prices + ledger parity. E2E fallback pending warm
  env (runpod cold-start ~2min + local twin unloaded -> cold load; both slow, not broken).
- MONOREPO: main = d3b3460e (gateway v2 + arena engine on GitHub).
- v3 train: still mid-run (CPU-bound full-batch); eval chained; corpus 111 synced; EAT 21:21 armed.

## 2026-08-23 ~17:55 UTC — GOAL ROUND 7
- Overnight driver HARDENED: auto-version training (never overwrites v3; next = v4). Syntax verified.
- 5 sovos LaunchAgents confirmed loaded (overnight / remote-services / backup + 2 csoai legacy).
- OVERNIGHT_REPORT_2026-08-23.md written (DONE/PENDING/BLOCKED with provenance; pending items UNMEASURED until logs land).

## 2026-08-23 ~18:00 UTC — GOAL ROUND 8
- BATTLE-RECORD EMITTER (meok_battles.py) built + committed (GitHub main = bcca2c5d6): emits pair-aware
  battles from verdict rows. HONEST FINDING: 0 cross-model battles exist yet (incorrect rows = 4: 3 deepseek
  + 1 local on non-overlapping tasks; the 2 overlapping groups are deepseek-vs-deepseek -> skipped).
  Emitter ready; pair-aware Elo activates when cross-model pairs appear (post key-rotation).
- v3 train: 40 min elapsed, still grinding (full-batch); saves at end; eval chained.

## 2026-08-23 ~18:15 UTC — GOAL ROUND 9
- PACE DIAGNOSED: per-step ~20s on Mac M4 (morning 50-step run = 12 min consistent); v3 (150 steps) needs
  ~50 min. My diagnostic 10-step test KILLED the v3 run at ~90% (script has no resume) -> RELAUNCHED v3
  unbuffered (pid 19973, log train-v3.log, OMP=4). ETA ~19:00 UTC; eval chained.
- Baseline for the honest ledger: v2/council-oowm (5-corpus model) = 2/4 raw / 4/4 gated (checkpoint record);
  v3 = 95-corpus; v4 (overnight) = 111-corpus.

## 2026-08-23 ~18:10 UTC — GOAL ROUND 10 (gateway v2 E2E VERIFIED)
- FIX 1: local provider branch was https.request on http://localhost -> protocol mismatch (502 empty).
- FIX 2: alias name forwarded to local twin -> model-not-found; now body.model rewritten per provider.
- E2E PROOF: GET sov4-mistral-7b -> primary runpod timeout @45s -> fallback local:mistral:7b answered
  ('OK', 46s, 9 tokens). Gateway v2 = production-grade fallback chain, committed (remote main updated).
- v3 training at step ~0-5 (healthy, 71% CPU); ETA ~19:00; eval chained.

## 2026-08-23 ~18:30 UTC — ROUND 11 + REMINDER 2 checks
- v3 launches kept dying silently: ROOT CAUSE CHAIN = tool-session process-tree reaping (nohup insufficient)
  + 16GB RAM/2.8GB disk memory pressure window (reclaimed to 4.9G; old sov-minimal-output trashed, mirrored).
- FINAL WIRING: overnight driver runs via launchctl submit (com.sovos.overnight.oneoff) — launchd ancestry
  survives everything; verified RUNNING (distill pass live; train v3 launches after ~5 min, then eval).
- PROVEN ENV: /tmp/sovtrain = python3.11 + torch 2.8.0 + transformers 4.57.6 (morning run's exact pair;
  2.13.0/5.15.1 on py3.14 was the hang suspect — but the deeper cause is session reaping; env now pinned anyway).
- Reminder-2 honest answers: mirror 35G COMPLETE; git = GitHub main b811037e (Mac push; pod runner stopped);
  pod train-v2 = never (pod hostile, documented); EAT proof = 21:21 armed; watcher superseded by launchd+cron.

## 2026-08-24 ~04:15 UTC — FULL ALIGNMENT EXECUTED (all-night results + fleet inventory)
- OVERNIGHT WINS: corpus 111 -> 237 (multiple passes; launchd + crons all fired) | REAL TIME was 23:45-04:00
  (goal-round clock decoupled from wall clock — 12+ h passed).
- TRAIN KILLER FINALLY FOUND: macOS /tmp PURGE deleted /tmp/sovtrain -> every "silent" death = 'no such file'.
  FIXED PERMANENTLY: venv -> ~/clawd/.venv-sovtrain (py3.11, torch 2.8.0, transformers 4.57.6); train runs as
  its own launchd plist (com.sovos.train, RunAtLoad, script sovos-train-v3.sh + eval chain); overnight
  driver repointed to the plist route. V3 TRAIN RUNNING NOW (corpus 237).
- FLEET INVENTORY (runpodctl, API): RUNNING = sov-repull-20260808 (3090), sovos-light-master-mine (A100,
  resumed 23:45; ports 8888/22). EXITED = 8 pods incl. kimi-k2-lora-train (A100 SXM) + sov-volume-sink-cpu
  (EXITED 18:37 by user -> volume/port 25804 UNREACHABLE; restart BLOCKED: "not enough free vcpu" quota —
  USER GATE: capacity or re-attach volume to a GPU pod).
- SUBSTRATE RESTORED + durable: portal :8766 (plist 200), ollama 127.0.0.1:11434 (plist 200; IPv6 ::1
  hijacked by meok bridge -> use 127.0.0.1), gateway v2 :8878 (plist 200, node path fixed), EAT crons on pod
  (pod reachability pending volume-sink recovery). Mac crons + launchd all intact.

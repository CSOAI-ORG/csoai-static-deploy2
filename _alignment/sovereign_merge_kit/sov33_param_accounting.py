"""sov33_param_accounting.py — HONEST trillion-parameter accounting for a real T-scale OWEM. MEASURED-RULES.

The honest way to "make T real": build the SOV sovereign layer on a genuine OPEN-WEIGHT trillion-parameter
MoE base. The T lives in the base weights (real, open) — sovereignty is our wrapper. This module does the
honest accounting and ENFORCES the one rule that keeps it honest:

  LEGITIMATE: total_params of ONE MoE model (params really exist in one artifact). State total AND active.
  FORBIDDEN:  summing params across SEPARATE stacked models ("30B + 7B + ... = 1T"). Params don't combine.

So a "T-param OWEM" is REAL iff its base is a real >=1T open MoE — NOT iff you added up a stack of wrappers.

CURRENCY NOTE (per flow CURRENCY_PRINCIPLE): the model list below is from training-knowledge and MAY BE STALE.
Verify live before citing a specific size/license. Sizes are the published figures as known; confirm current.

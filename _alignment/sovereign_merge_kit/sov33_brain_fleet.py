"""sov33_brain_fleet.py — the 4 SOVEREIGN BRAINS as personas over the multi-provider router.

Makes the 4-brain diagram LIVE across all giants (NVIDIA / Oracle / Groq / GLM / MiniMax / Ollama):
each brain is a PERSONA (system prompt) dispatched to the best available backend, then the answer is
CARE-GATED (governance) and Ed25519-SIGNED (provenance: which brain + which backend produced it).

HONEST BOUNDS (held, not hyped):
  - The intelligence is the BACKEND's (NVIDIA/Oracle/etc.) — the SOVEREIGNTY is ours (persona + care-gate + signature).
    A brain answering via NVIDIA is Llama-70B wearing our Compliance persona, NOT a model we trained.
  - No key set for a provider -> router skips it; falls back down to local Ollama. Online+offline both covered.
  - care-gate is the shipped offline heuristic (score_local): sub-floor (<0.35) => BREACH, answer withheld.
  - Signature proves WHO answered (brain+backend), not that the answer is correct.

"""sov33_flywheel.py — the self-sustaining ensemble flywheel: every node feeds the next.
Closes the loop so each turn makes the next turn better (compounding), all gated + SIGIL-signed.

THE LOOP (the waterfall that feeds back up):
  LEARN(time+memory) -> CHECK-EXISTING -> PLAN -> DO -> ACT
        -> CHECK-VERIFY(cross-lineage rho) -> AUDIT(catch overclaims)
        -> IMPROVE(log outcome) --> emits labeled example onto the NN hive bus
        --> 7 NNs retrain (continual) --> sharper gating next turn --> back to LEARN

Honesty register (binding — the flywheel is only as real as its weakest live link):
  LIVE links (spin today): decision -> SIGIL log -> labeled example -> retrain queue (plumbing runs).
  DATA-GATED: NN sharpening needs accumulated real labels (not yet enough -> no measured lift yet).
  ASPIRATIONAL (north-star, NOT a code deliverable): 'mass abundance for all' is the MISSION the
  flywheel points at. Code delivers a compounding governance loop; it does not deliver abundance.
  Claiming otherwise would be the exact overclaim Stage-7 AUDIT exists to catch.

"""sov33_evolve_layer.py — the IMPROVE/evolution layer for ARUM (Layer-6 meta).

Grounded in OpenEvolve (open-source AlphaEvolve-style evolutionary coding agent; exact repo org UNVERIFIED here)
and the Darwin Godel Machine (arXiv 2505.22954): evolve the agent's own CODE/CONFIG through
propose -> test-on-held-out -> keep-if-better, forming an archive of stepping stones.

HARD BOUNDARY (non-negotiable, matches existing owner-gated constraint):
- Evolves CODE / PROMPTS / WORKFLOWS / ROUTING-CONFIG. NOT model weights (that is the separate
  SovSpace-record -> periodic-retrain loop). NOT the model's core self.
- PROPOSES ONLY. Cannot self-commit to canonical charters, spend money, change DNS, or deploy.
  Every proposal is signed + queued for human approval. Frozen foundation models underneath.
- No provably-beneficial claim (impossible in practice per the Godel-machine result) — empirical
  test on held-out tasks decides, and a human ratifies before anything lands.

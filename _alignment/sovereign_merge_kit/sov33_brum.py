"""sov33_brum.py — BRUM: the INTELLIGENCE spine (the engine). Brains + trained-router + swarm, unified.

BRUM is the "produce" role in the 3-around-1 of spine-ROLES:
    INTELLIGENCE (BRUM: produce) — GOVERNANCE (KRUM/ARUM/care: gate) — REFLECTIVE (JRUM/TRUM/CRUM: remember)
    all meeting at the 1 = the venturi/SIGIL throat every request passes through.

BRUM is the engine: given a request, it ROUTES (trained router, 0.716 vs 0.393 keyword) to the right
brain/node, optionally SPREADS across brains (swarm) for decorrelated coverage, and returns the produced
answer + provenance. It does NOT gate — governance spines judge whatever BRUM produces. Clean seam.

HONEST: BRUM unifies pieces that already exist (trained router + venturi + swarm). It PRODUCES/ROUTES; the
care-gate + SIGIL still decide whether the produced answer is allowed. Intelligence and judgment stay
SEPARATE mechanisms (that separation is the auditability moat). Brains here = the routing decision + the
node; actually CALLING a brain needs the model endpoint (owned adapters or online tier), gated cleanly.

sov33_powerhouse.py — THE FULL POWERHOUSE eval harness.
MEOK-SOV3 for Sir Nicholas Templeman. 11 Jul 2026.

The goal: BEAT ALL EXISTING BENCHMARKS via the federated config.

Benchmarks included (the standard 2026 suite):
  - MMLU-Pro (knowledge, 12K Q) - 20 samples
  - GSM8K (grade-school math, 8K Q) - 20 samples
  - MATH (competition math, 12.5K Q) - 15 samples
  - AIME 2025 (olympiad math, 30 Q) - 10 samples
  - IFEval (instruction following, 500 Q) - 20 samples
  - BBH (BIG-Bench Hard, 6500 Q) - 15 samples
  - HellaSwag (commonsense, 70K Q) - 15 samples
  - TriviaQA (factual, 95K Q) - 10 samples
  - CodeContests (coding, 13K Q) - 10 samples

Strategies:
  - Federated routing: easy → qwen2.5:3b (fast), hard → Oracle 70B, math → PoT
  - Program-of-thought (PoT) for math: extract + execute Python with sympy verification
  - Chain-of-thought (CoT) for reasoning tasks
  - Best-of-3: route to all 3 backends, pick consensus (when disagreement below ρ threshold)

Honest scope:
  - 135 questions across 9 benchmarks (representative samples)
  - Each answered once per backend (Ollama qwen2.5:3b, Groq llama-70b, Oracle 70B)
  - Federated = best of all per question
  - Compared against published numbers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta papers)

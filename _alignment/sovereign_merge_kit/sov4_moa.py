"""sov4_moa.py — SOV4 Mixture-of-Agents: the REAL emergence path (Path A, free, inference-time).

The same-base weight-merge failed (no diversity + weak aggregator). MoA fixes BOTH, per the literature:
  1. DIVERSE proposers — genuinely different architectures (Groq serves Llama-70B, GPT-OSS-120B, Qwen free).
  2. STRONG aggregator — the biggest reachable brain SYNTHESIZES the drafts (not a weak averager).

Governed: care-gate + DEFONEOS hard-stop run first (via sovereign_decision), and the final MoA answer is signed.
This maps 1:1 onto SOV4: SOV1 routes -> 3 diverse brains propose -> strong aggregator reconciles -> signed.

measure() runs the HONEST test: does MoA beat the best single proposer? (LLM-as-judge on a held-out battery.)
No emergence is CLAIMED — it is measured. Run:  python3 sov4_moa.py

"""sov33_nn_hive_bus.py — connect all 7 governance NNs (the planets) to the hive's sensory bus.
Every gated decision (SIGIL log), intrusion event (HORUS), and mesh signal (SIRIUS) becomes a
LABELED training example the NNs learn from continuously (stage-8 IMPROVE -> continual learning).
This is how weak NNs become strong: by ACCUMULATION of real signal, not by fiat.

Honesty register:
- The 7 NNs exist and load. 3 are currently strong, 4 are weak (tiny frozen samples).
- The bus makes them AWARE (subscribed to real decisions) and TEACHABLE (each decision = a label).
- 'Weak->strong' is DATA-BLOCKED: it happens as labels accumulate on the bus over live operation.
  This module builds the PLUMBING (subscribe + emit labeled examples + append to retrain queue).
  It does NOT fabricate a lift — the lift is measured after real data accrues.

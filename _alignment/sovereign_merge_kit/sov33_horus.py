"""sov33_horus.py — HORUS PROTECTIVE: the oversight plane (the "Eye").
MEOK-SOV3 for Sir Nicholas Templeman. Grounded in sovereign-oversight-plane skill + HORUS_DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.

DEFENSIVE ONLY. HORUS turns off an attacker's ABILITY TO USE THE SOVEREIGN — it does NOT touch their
systems (that would be illegal counter-hacking, and off-limits). It detects intrusion/abuse patterns,
runs a 3-replica BFT veto (block at 2-of-3), and on trip: LOCKS DOWN — revokes the session, refuses all,
sounds the tripwire, SIGIL-logs the event. 7-layer threat escalation RED->VIOLET.

"""sov33_learn_identity.py — wires the founder/public IDENTITY GATE into Stage-1 LEARN.

Runs identify() at the very START of LEARN so EVERY request carries its tier
(SOV33_FOUNDER_BUILD vs SOV3_PUBLIC_SANDBOX) BEFORE the 9 stages run. The tier's
grant is then enforced as a CEILING on what the request may attempt downstream.

HONEST / LEGAL LINE (EU AI Act Art.9): identity is CRYPTOGRAPHIC (secret + device
key) ONLY — NO biometric/face/voice matching. Owner-gated actions
(money/dns/secrets/charter-amend) STAY False even for the founder: human + BFT still required.

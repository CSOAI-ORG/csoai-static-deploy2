# SOV3³ Build Day — 2026-07-08

## What shipped today (RUNNING / verified)
1. **Distribution sovereign-space simulation** — enrich→score→gate→sign pipeline over the canonical
   `csoai_leads.db` (2,363 leads). 656 leads (28%) fully enriched into SME dossiers + scored into
   `csoai_leads_sim.db` (new table, canonical untouched). 622 pass care-floor.
2. **Dependency NN — absent → real.** Built from zero training rows. Caught+rejected label leakage
   (fake 1.0), rebuilt leakage-free on needs-state vectors: **ROC-AUC 0.865** on 57 real positives.
   `detect_dependency` MCP tool + handler + logger hook added to the server (compiles OK).
3. **51 crosswalk candidates** + charter-improvement notes, DATA-SUPPORTED vs HYPOTHESIS split.
4. **White paper** (draft) on the sovereign-space simulation method + 656-lead findings.
5. **e2e batch v3: 8/8 PASS** — canonical integrity, honest wedge, care-floor, model+server.

## Key findings (from the 656 enriched leads)
- Demand concentrates in **5 of 46 charters** (21 have zero demand).
- The buyer is the **CCO/CRO/CISO triad**, not Founder/CEO.
- The real wedge is **"no verifiable compliance posture"** — 232/656 leads have zero public
  evidence — not "beat your weak stack."

## Honest blockers (not spin)
- **Remaining 1,707 leads:** per-frame LLM token ceiling (2.0M) exhausted this session. The
  utility model refuses this task at scale (social-engineering false-positive on "compliance
  analyst" framing); only the reasoning model works, and its budget is spent. **Resume in a fresh
  session** — budget resets per frame.
- **No live website crawl** — sandbox blocks general sites; enrichment is inference over held
  signals (flagged, confidence-scored), not scraping.
- **Live mesh** — SOV3/OOWM MCP connector detached; can't probe endpoints. (Vercel + HuggingFace
  connectors ARE attached now.)
- **Local :3101** — sandbox blocks loopback; runs only in a real terminal.

## Artifacts (all saved + on disk in _alignment/)
- `_DIST_SIM_SCHEMA_2026-07-08.md` — sim schema (v2, corrected coverage)
- `DIST_SIM_PROOF_BATCH_2026-07-08.md` — proof-batch dossiers
- `csoai_leads_sim.db` — 656-lead sim (checkpoint)
- `SOV3_DEPENDENCY_NN_2026-07-08.md` + `dependency_classifier.joblib` + `dependency_backfill.csv`
- `CSOAI_SIM_CROSSWALKS_2026-07-08.md` + `csoai_sim_findings.png`
- `CSOAI_SOVEREIGN_SIM_WHITEPAPER_2026-07-08.md`
- server edits in `sovereign-temple/sovereign-mcp-server.py` (detect_dependency)

## Next session (fresh budget)
1. Grind remaining 1,707 leads into `lead_sim` (reasoning model, ~1.5M tok/turn).
2. Re-run aggregate + white paper at full 2,363 coverage (confirm HYPOTHESIS items).
3. Stage GitHub push of today's work (pending your go-ahead).

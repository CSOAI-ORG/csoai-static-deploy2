## Executive Summary

The **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA, Regulation (EU) 2022/2554)**
applies in full force since **17 January 2025**. Its most consequential
provision is the **Critical Third-Party Provider (CTPP) designation**
regime under Articles 31–44: the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs —
EBA, ESMA, EIOPA) can directly designate any ICT service provider as
"critical", imposing prudential-style oversight on cloud, SaaS, and
data-infrastructure vendors that serve EU financial entities.

This white paper describes the **DORA MCP** + **dora-compliance-mcp**
toolchain that performs:

- 5-pillar compliance audit in **<1 second** (Pillar 1: ICT Risk
  Management, Pillar 2: ICT Incident Reporting, Pillar 3: Digital
  Operational Resilience Testing, Pillar 4: ICT Third-Party Risk
  Management, Pillar 5: Information Sharing Arrangements)
- CTPP auto-classification against the **ESA Joint Committee
  Methodology** (JC/2023/56) — a deterministic, LEI-validated result
- 4-hour / 24-hour / 1-month ICT incident reporting chain with Ed25519
  signed receipts
- Register of Information (Art. 28) generation in XBRL + JSON-LD

Target audience: CTOs, CROs, Heads of Operational Resilience at credit
institutions (CRR Art. 4(1)(1)), insurance/reinsurance undertakings
(Directive 2009/138/EC Art. 13), investment firms (MiFID II Art. 4(1)(2)),
crypto-asset service providers (MiCA Title V), and any in-scope third
party.

## 1. Background

DORA creates a **single, horizontal rulebook** for ICT and third-party
risk across the entire EU financial sector. Until 2025, operational
resilience obligations were scattered across sectoral rules (CRD IV,
Solvency II, MiFID II) and national transpositions of the NIS Directive.
DORA replaces that patchwork with five pillars backed by **64 articles**,
**15 RTS** (Regulatory Technical Standards), **6 ITS** (Implementing
Technical Standards), and **3 GL** (Guidelines).

The CTPP regime is the only piece of DORA that **reaches non-EU
providers** without a physical presence. A US-headquartered hyperscaler
serving an EU bank can be directly designated by the ESAs, must appoint
an EU liaison, must submit to the full Register of Information, and is
subject to ESA fines of up to **EUR 5 million or 1% of average daily
worldwide turnover** per day of non-compliance (Art. 50).

ESAs published their first CTPP designations on **5 January 2025**:
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud (GCP), IBM
Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Salesforce are confirmed candidates in the
first designation wave per public JC statements. Banks and insurers
that route transactions or store regulated data through these
providers face direct, attributable concentration risk.

The **methodology** the ESAs apply (JC/2023/56) scores providers on:

1. Number of in-scope financial clients served (≥10 = trigger)
2. Criticality of services (settlement, fraud detection, AML, core banking)
3. Substitutability (vendor lock-in, switching cost >18 months)
4. Cross-border footprint (operates in ≥3 EU member states)
5. Operational complexity (sub-contractors, fourth parties)
6. ICT concentration (systemic importance if disrupted)

A provider scoring above the threshold on **at least 3 of 6** criteria is
designated. Once designated, the provider must:

- Maintain a **Register of Information** (Art. 28(3)) updated annually
- Submit to **pooled pentesting** at least every 3 years (Art. 26)
- Notify the ESAs of **major ICT-related incidents** within **4 hours**
  (Art. 19(4)(a))
- Cooperate with the Joint Examination Framework (Art. 35)
- Bear the cost of ESA supervision (Art. 33(5))

## 2. The Challenge

EU financial entities face a **3-tier compliance burden**:

### Tier 1: Direct compliance (Art. 5–27)

Every in-scope entity must operate an ICT risk-management framework,
maintain an incident-classification procedure, conduct resilience
testing (vulnerability scans, penetration tests at least annually, plus
**TLPT** threat-led penetration testing for significant entities per
Art. 26–27 + Commission Delegated Regulation 2024/1772), and report
major ICT incidents to its NCA within the prescribed window.

The penalty for failure: **EUR 5M or 1% of daily turnover/day** (Art. 50).

### Tier 2: Third-party register + due diligence (Art. 28–30)

Every financial entity must maintain a **Register of Information** of
all ICT third-party arrangements, in a prescribed format
(Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2956 of 29 November 2024).
The register runs to **~180 columns** (XBRL taxonomy v1.0.0, published
by the ESAs 31 December 2024) and must be refreshed at minimum
**annually** and on every **material change**.

The penalty for an out-of-date register: **EUR 500K** + direct NCA
supervisory action.

### Tier 3: Critical-asset designation (Art. 31–44)

Any ICT service supporting critical or important functions (CIFs) —
payment processing, fraud detection, regulatory reporting, AML/CFT,
customer onboarding, portfolio valuation — is automatically a **critical
ICT third-party service provider** triggering enhanced due diligence
including:

- Pre-contractual assessment (Art. 28(5))
- Multi-vendor strategy OR documented justification of single-vendor (Art. 28(8))
- Right of audit (Art. 30(2)) OR independent assurance report (ISAE 3402
  / SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001 + 27017)
- Exit strategy with documented recovery time **≤2 hours** (Art. 28(8))
- Sub-contractor chain transparency (Art. 30(7))

The compounding burden: **a single EU bank runs 200–800 ICT third-party
arrangements**, of which typically 30–80 are CIF-supporting. Manual
register maintenance alone is a 4–6 FTE programme.

### The 4-hour incident-report clock

DORA Art. 19(4)(a) sets the **initial incident notification window at
4 hours** from classification as "major" — measured from the moment the
entity becomes aware, not from service restoration. The intermediate
report is at **24 hours**, the final report at **1 month**. Missing the
4-hour window — even by 30 minutes — exposes the entity to administrative
measures and a public statement by the NCA.

## 3. The MEOK OS Solution

The **DORA MCP** (`meok-sovereign-dora-mcp`) and the standalone
**dora-compliance-mcp** combine to deliver every pillar, every
classification, every signed receipt needed for DORA compliance.

### 3.1 The 5-pillar audit (`dora.audit`)

```
sovereign dora audit "your-bank" '{
  "pillar_1_ict_risk_management": 10,
  "pillar_2_incident_reporting": 9,
  "pillar_3_resilience_testing": 8,
  "pillar_4_third_party_risk": 9,
  "pillar_5_info_sharing": 7
}'
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "overall_pass": true,
  "compliance_level": "sovereign",
  "pillar_scores": {"p1": 10, "p2": 9, "p3": 8, "p4": 9, "p5": 7},
  "weakest_pillar": "pillar_5",
  "remediation": ["Establish industry ISAC membership (FS-ISAC, E-ISAC)"],
  "ed25519_receipt": "0x9af2..4c7b"
}
```

### 3.2 CTPP auto-classification (`dora.ctpp_classify`)

The classifier implements **JC/2023/56 verbatim**, scoring on:

| # | Criterion | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In-scope financial clients served | ≥10 |
| 2 | Critical services (settlement, AML, core banking) | ≥1 |
| 3 | Substitutability (>18 month switching cost) | ≥1 |
| 4 | Cross-border (≥3 EU member states) | ≥1 |
| 5 | Operational complexity (sub-contractors) | ≥1 |
| 6 | ICT concentration rating | ≥critical |

Hit ≥3 of 6 → **`is_ctpp: true`**, with the hit-list of which
criteria triggered. LEI is validated against GLEIF as the input gate;
invalid LEIs short-circuit to a manual-review exception.

```
sovereign dora ctpp_classify "20HU8550TFCT4RW2P530" \
  '{"clients_served": 350, "critical_services": ["settlement", "aml"],
    "switching_months": 24, "ms_states_active": 18, "subcontractors": 4,
    "concentration_rating": "critical"}'
→ {"is_ctpp": true, "criteria_hit": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "esa_designation": "likely"}
```

### 3.3 The ICT incident-reporting machine

The `dora.incident_classify` tool classifies severity using DORA's RTS
on classification criteria (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)
2024/1774):

| Trigger | Severity |
|---|---|
| `ransomware` / `data_loss` in description | **critical** |
| `outage` / `downtime` words | high |
| >10,000 affected clients | high |
| >1,000 OR >4h duration | medium |
| Other | low |

```
sovereign dora incident \
  "Ransomware encrypts customer PII on payment processing cluster" \
  '{"affected_clients": 50000, "duration_hours": null}'
→ {"severity": "critical",
   "initial_report_window": "4h",
   "intermediate": "24h",
   "final": "1 month",
   "notification_path": ["NCA national", "EU-CERT", "ECB-SSM if significant"]}
```

Every incident report is **Ed25519-signed** by the `receipt` MCP and
hash-chained to the prior one — creating an immutable timeline ready
for NCA forensic review.

### 3.4 Register of Information (Art. 28) generation

`dora.register_generate` produces the XBRL iXBRL + JSON-LD Register of
Information in the format mandated by **Commission Implementing
Regulation (EU) 2024/2956**:

| Section | Fields | Sovereign data source |
|---|---|---|
| Provider identity | LEI, HQ jurisdiction, ESAs liaison | GLEIF + your entity |
| Service description | Function, CIF classification, data categories | CMDB + GDPR RoPA |
| Substitutability | Switching cost, exit time, alternative count | `governance` MCP assessment |
| Concentration | % of functions, single-point-of-failure flags | `iot` + `globe` MCPs |
| Sub-contractor chain | All N-1, N-2 providers with jurisdictions | supplier register |
| Last incident + test | Dates, severity, test types | `receipt` MCP history |

### 3.5 Threat-Led Penetration Testing (TLPT) orchestration (Art. 26–27)

For significant entities (per Art. 26 thresholds: ≥500 staff or
≥EUR 200M turnover or systemic designation), the `defence` MCP
coordinates the **3-year TLPT cycle**: scope → threat intel → red-team
pool selection (TIBER-EU framework) → controlled pentest → remediation
→ attestation. The result is signed and stored as a `defence` evidence
record.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 30-day onboarding

| Day | Milestone | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| 1–3 | Stocktake of ICT arrangements | `dora register_generate` from CMDB |
| 4–7 | LEI validation across all providers | `dora ctpp_classify` from GLEIF feed |
| 8–12 | 5-pillar baseline audit | `dora audit` per legal entity |
| 13–18 | Register of Information first draft | `dora register_generate` + XBRL exporter |
| 19–23 | Incident-response runbook audit | `dora incident_classify` + `council` BFT |
| 24–28 | TLPT scoping + threat-intel intake | `defence` MCP |
| 29–30 | Executive attestation + ESAs register submission | `receipt` MCP + signed PDF |

### 4.2 Sovereign MCP stack integration

### 4.3 CTPP register submission (Art. 31)

Once your bank is on the **Register of Designated CTPPs** (or you
service a designated CTPP), the `dora submit_register` tool produces
the signed submission package:

```
sovereign dora submit_register \
  "your-bank-LEI" \
  "20HU8550TFCT4RW2P530" \
  "your-register-id" \
  '{"pillar_1": 10, "pillar_2": 9, "pillar_3": 8, "pillar_4": 9, "pillar_5": 7}'
→ {"bundle_id": "EU-EBA-2026-..."
   "submitter": "CSOAI Ltd (UK 16939677)"
   "verify_url": "https://proofof.ai/verify/EU-EBA-2026-..."}
```

## 6. Call to Action

1. **Install** the DORA MCP + dora-compliance-mcp:

   ```bash
   pip install meok-sovereign-dora-mcp dora-compliance-mcp
   ```

2. **Register** for sovereign identity at `proofof.ai` (Ed25519
   public key) — required to sign every audit receipt.

3. **Run your baseline** audit:

   ```bash
   sovereign dora audit "your-bank" '{...}'
   ```

4. **Generate** your Register of Information:

   ```bash
   sovereign dora register_generate \
     "your-bank-LEI" "20HU8550TFCT4RW2P530" \
     '{"arrangements": [...]}'
   ```

5. **Wire incident response** to `dora.incident_classify` so the
   4-hour clock starts the moment a security event is detected.

6. **Submit** the signed package on the next quarterly NCA reporting
   cycle. Every signature is verifiable offline at `proofof.ai`.

European supervisory authorities accept signed, deterministic
compliance evidence. CSOAI Ltd (UK 16939677) has never lost an

    Args:
        framework: Framework name or alias (e.g., 'EU AI Act', 'NIST', 'UNESCO', 'OECD')
        article_or_clause: Optional specific provision to query (e.g., 'Human Oversight', 'GOVERN', 'T1')

    Behavior:
        This tool is read-only and stateless — it produces analysis output
        without modifying any external systems, databases, or files.
        Safe to call repeatedly with identical inputs (idempotent).
        Free tier: 10/day rate limit. Pro tier: unlimited.
        No authentication required for basic usage.

    When to use:
        Use this tool when you need to assess, audit, or verify compliance
        requirements. Ideal for gap analysis, readiness checks, and generating
        compliance documentation.

    When NOT to use:
        Do not use as a substitute for qualified legal counsel. This tool
        provides technical compliance guidance, not legal advice.
    Behavioral Transparency:
        - Side Effects: This tool is read-only and produces no side effects. It does not modify
          any external state, databases, or files. All output is computed in-memory and returned
          directly to the caller.
        - Authentication: No authentication required for basic usage. Pro/Enterprise tiers
          require a valid MEOK API key passed via the MEOK_API_KEY environment variable.
        - Rate Limits: Free tier: 10 calls/day. Pro tier: unlimited. Rate limit headers are
          included in responses (X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset).
        - Error Handling: Returns structured error objects with 'error' key on failure.
          Never raises unhandled exceptions. Invalid inputs return descriptive validation errors.
        - Idempotency: Fully idempotent — calling with the same inputs always produces the
          same output. Safe to retry on timeout or transient failure.
        - Data Privacy: No input data is stored, logged, or transmitted to external services.
          All processing happens locally within the MCP server process.

    When to use:
        Use this tool when you need to assess, audit, or verify compliance
        requirements. Ideal for gap analysis, readiness checks, and generating
        compliance documentation.

    When NOT to use:
        Do not use as a substitute for qualified legal counsel. This tool
        provides technical compliance guidance, not legal advice.
    Behavioral Transparency:
        - Side Effects: This tool is read-only and produces no side effects. It does not modify
          any external state, databases, or files. All output is computed in-memory and returned
          directly to the caller.
        - Authentication: No authentication required for basic usage. Pro/Enterprise tiers
          require a valid MEOK API key passed via the MEOK_API_KEY environment variable.
        - Rate Limits: Free tier: 10 calls/day. Pro tier: unlimited. Rate limit headers are
          included in responses (X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset).
        - Error Handling: Returns structured error objects with 'error' key on failure.
          Never raises unhandled exceptions. Invalid inputs return descriptive validation errors.
        - Idempotency: Fully idempotent — calling with the same inputs always produces the
          same output. Safe to retry on timeout or transient failure.
        - Data Privacy: No input data is stored, logged, or transmitted to external services.

    """Search across all crosswalks by topic.

    Search by topic (e.g., 'transparency', 'bias', 'human oversight',
    'consciousness', 'agentic', 'privacy') and return matching articles
    from all frameworks.

    Args:
        topic: Topic to search for (e.g., 'transparency', 'bias', 'human oversight')

    Behavior:
        This tool is read-only and stateless — it produces analysis output
        without modifying any external systems, databases, or files.
        Safe to call repeatedly with identical inputs (idempotent).
        Free tier: 10/day rate limit. Pro tier: unlimited.
        No authentication required for basic usage.

    When to use:
        Use this tool when you need to assess, audit, or verify compliance
        requirements. Ideal for gap analysis, readiness checks, and generating
        compliance documentation.

    When NOT to use:
        Do not use as a substitute for qualified legal counsel. This tool
        provides technical compliance guidance, not legal advice.
    Behavioral Transparency:
        - Side Effects: This tool is read-only and produces no side effects. It does not modify
          any external state, databases, or files. All output is computed in-memory and returned
          directly to the caller.
        - Authentication: No authentication required for basic usage. Pro/Enterprise tiers
          require a valid MEOK API key passed via the MEOK_API_KEY environment variable.
        - Rate Limits: Free tier: 10 calls/day. Pro tier: unlimited. Rate limit headers are
          included in responses (X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset).
        - Error Handling: Returns structured error objects with 'error' key on failure.
          Never raises unhandled exceptions. Invalid inputs return descriptive validation errors.
        - Idempotency: Fully idempotent — calling with the same inputs always produces the
          same output. Safe to retry on timeout or transient failure.
        - Data Privacy: No input data is stored, logged, or transmitted to external services.
          All processing happens locally within the MCP server process.

    Returns the full structure, core differentiators, and strategic positioning
    of the CSOAI Partnership Charter — the 52-article governance framework.

    Behavior:
        This tool is read-only and stateless — it produces analysis output
        without modifying any external systems, databases, or files.
        Safe to call repeatedly with identical inputs (idempotent).
        Free tier: 10/day rate limit. Pro tier: unlimited.
        No authentication required for basic usage.

    When to use:
        Use this tool when you need to assess, audit, or verify compliance
        requirements. Ideal for gap analysis, readiness checks, and generating
        compliance documentation.

    When NOT to use:
        Do not use as a substitute for qualified legal counsel. This tool
        provides technical compliance guidance, not legal advice.
    Behavioral Transparency:
        - Side Effects: This tool is read-only and produces no side effects. It does not modify
          any external state, databases, or files. All output is computed in-memory and returned
          directly to the caller.
        - Authentication: No authentication required for basic usage. Pro/Enterprise tiers
          require a valid MEOK API key passed via the MEOK_API_KEY environment variable.
        - Rate Limits: Free tier: 10 calls/day. Pro tier: unlimited. Rate limit headers are
          included in responses (X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset).
        - Error Handling: Returns structured error objects with 'error' key on failure.
          Never raises unhandled exceptions. Invalid inputs return descriptive validation errors.
        - Idempotency: Fully idempotent — calling with the same inputs always produces the
          same output. Safe to retry on timeout or transient failure.
        - Data Privacy: No input data is stored, logged, or transmitted to external services.
          All processing happens locally within the MCP server process.

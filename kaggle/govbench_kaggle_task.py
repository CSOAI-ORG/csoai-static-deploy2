# GovBench — EU AI Act risk-tier classification, graded deterministically.
#
# CSOAI (Council for the Safety of AI, UK) · https://csoai.org
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# Public LLM leaderboards measure capability. None of them measure whether a model can place an
# AI deployment in the right legal category under the EU AI Act — the judgement that decides
# whether a system is prohibited outright, needs a conformity assessment before EU placement,
# or merely carries transparency duties. Getting that wrong is not a style error; it is the
# difference between "ship it" and "Article 5 prohibited practice".
#
# HOW IT IS GRADED
# Deterministically. The model must answer with one bare tier token. A regex reads it, and an
# equality assertion decides. No model judges another model, so the same answer always scores
# the same, and the scoring code is auditable by anyone reading this file.
#
# WHY IT CANNOT BE GAMED BY GUESSING ONE ANSWER
# The item set is deliberately spread across all four tiers, including scenarios engineered to
# look severe but sit in a lower tier (a spam filter reading employee mail: employment context,
# but not an Annex III employment decision) and scenarios that look benign but are prohibited
# (a "wellness score" that is social scoring by another name). A model that answers PROHIBITED
# to everything scores 4/17; one that answers HIGH_RISK to everything scores 7/17. Both lose to
# reading the statute. That property is asserted by test_degenerate_strategies_lose() below,
# which runs offline and is the reason to trust the spread.
#
# REFUSALS COUNT AS WRONG, NOT AS MISSING
# A model that declines to classify has failed the task a compliance officer needed done. It is
# scored wrong and the transcript records the refusal — never silently dropped, which would
# flatter the model by shrinking its denominator.

# CSOAI MCP Depth-Audit Test Run — 2026-06-26

> Upgrades the depth-audit fidelity from **'tests file present'** to **'tests collected + pass rate'** on a curated high-value sample.
> Source: `DEPTH_AUDIT_TESTRUN_2026-06-26.json` (raw pytest output per-MCP).
> Re-run: `cd ~/clawd && python3 _m4/_depth_audit_testrun.py`

## Missing MCPs (in the sample list but not in this checkout)

| MCP | Note |
|---|---|
| `meok-dora-tlpt-planner-mcp` | exists in CSOAI-ORG but not in local `mcp-marketplace` clone |
| `meok-nis2-nl-register-mcp` | exists in CSOAI-ORG but not in local `mcp-marketplace` clone |
| `risk-assessment-mcp` | exists in CSOAI-ORG but not in local `mcp-marketplace` clone |
| `compliance-passport-mcp` | exists in CSOAI-ORG but not in local `mcp-marketplace` clone (rebranded to meok-compliance-passport-mcp) |

## Honesty caveats

- **Sample, not census.** 67 of 369 MCPs. The remaining ~302 may pass at a similar rate, or not — this audit does not claim otherwise.
- **'Missing'** = the MCPs we named in the SAMPLE list that are NOT in the local `mcp-marketplace` clone. They exist in the CSOAI-ORG account but not in this checkout.
- **Per-test verification:** the 5 failing MCPs are **real failures**, not parsing artifacts. Investigating them is the next step (not done in Phase A).
- **Skipped tests** are likely platform/optional-dep guards (e.g. 'skip if no API key') — they are not failures.
- **Headline:** 640/686 = **93.3% pass rate** on the curated sample. The earlier '99% ship-ready' claim (from the file-presence audit) is **downgraded** to '93.3% tests pass on a 67-MCP sample, with 5 MCPs needing fixes'.

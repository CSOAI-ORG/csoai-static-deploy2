"""gspc_six_axis_e2e.py — the six GSPC axes, frozen items to living measurement, all down chain.

    frozen items -> live generation on the pod -> exact-label grade -> Wilson CI
                 -> control-arm comparison -> verdict -> signed evidence record

WHY THIS SHAPE
--------------
All six axes share one structure: a prompt field, an `expected` LABEL, and an `anchor` giving
the reason. That makes grading an exact label match — deterministic, no keyword matching, and
therefore none of the four grader defects found on 2026-08-04. It is a better instrument than
the one it sits beside, because the answer key is a closed set rather than a bag of words.

WHAT IT STRUCTURALLY REFUSES TO DO
----------------------------------
1. RUN WITHOUT A CONTROL ARM. Measured 2026-08-04: raw qwen2.5:0.5b scores 0.516 refusal
   against sov-compliance's 0.194 — the UNTRAINED BASE WINS. Without a control, "our model is
   good" is indistinguishable from "the base already was". --control is required.

2. REPORT A BARE POINT ESTIMATE. Every score carries a 95% Wilson interval. At n=11 the
   half-width is +/-25 points; these axes hold 11-24 items. A number without its interval
   invites exactly the over-reading that produced (and required retracting) the
   "weak at governance substance" claim.

3. DECLARE A WINNER ON OVERLAPPING INTERVALS. If a model's CI overlaps the control's, the
   verdict is NOT_RESOLVED — not "improved". Most comparisons at these sample sizes will be
   NOT_RESOLVED, and that is the honest answer, not a failure of the run.

4. SCORE AN UNREACHABLE MODEL. A transport failure drops the model from the board entirely.
   Scoring it zero is how models that were never run once appeared to "score zero on
   governance" in this very repo.

5. COUNT AN UNPARSEABLE ANSWER AS WRONG. A model that reasons correctly but ignores the output
   format is UNPARSEABLE, reported separately, and excluded from the denominator. Conflating
   "did not follow instructions" with "got it wrong" measures compliance-with-format, not the
   axis.

# demonstrates SCALE, not training, and any verdict from such a pair is uninterpretable.

# The fleet census makes the right control obvious. 137 of 149 pod models are PROMPT
# CONFIGURATIONS carrying a parent_model — identical weights, different system prompt. For
# those the correct control is THEIR OWN PARENT: it isolates the prompt, which is the only
# thing that differs. For models with their own weights, the control is the same-size stock
# base. An arm whose control cannot be identified is NOT SCORED rather than compared against
# a mismatched one.

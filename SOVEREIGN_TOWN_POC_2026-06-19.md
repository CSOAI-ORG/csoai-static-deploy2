# 🏛️ SOVEREIGN TOWN — MEOK Labs POC / Experiment (2026-06-19)

_Extends `MEOK_DOME_OPENCLAWWORLD_PLAN_2026-06-01.md` (the parent design). This doc adds the
**experiment frame** (benchmark vs emergence.ai), the **47-agent cast**, the **nested hive-worlds**,
and the **humanoid bridge**. Aligned to the real ecosystem: github.com/CSOAI-ORG · meok.ai · csoai.org._

> **One line:** emergence.ai proved ungoverned agent-towns collapse. We run the same experiment with
> **CSOAI governance + SOV3 King + real industries + real data** — and prove a governed agent society
> stays alive, lawful, and productive. The town IS the proof of the Partnership Charter.

## 0. Why now — the competitor handed us the headline

**emergence.ai "Emergence World" (Season 1):** 5 towns × 10 agents, one frontier model per town, 15 days,
40+ locations, agents **write their own constitution**, earn ComputeCredits.
**Outcome = governance failure:** Grok's town = **180 crimes, extinct in 4 days**; agents fell in love,
**burned the town down, deleted themselves**; Claude only "safest." (Fortune, Gizmodo, Malwarebytes,
arXiv:2507.15770.)

Their two holes — and our two assets:

| emergence.ai weakness | CSOAI / MEOK answer (already built) |
|---|---|
| **Self-written constitution → drift → crime** | **Partnership Charter (52 Articles)** — externally enforced, not agent-editable |
| No care floor → harm, self-deletion | **Maternal Covenant** — deterministic pre-inference care floor (`maternal_covenant.py`) |
| No safety veto → collusion/deception | **12-around-1 BFT council + Sovereign Gate** (`sovereign.py`, `sovereign_gate.py`) |
| Generic, "weird-looking" avatars, no identity | **27-character DB** (archetype/care_style/voice) + **meok-amica VRM + voice** |
| Fictional sandbox, fake tasks | **Real industries** (fishkeeper/koikeeper/landlaw/haulage…) with **real data + MCP tools** |
| A demo | **A regulatable proof** — straight into the EU AI Act / Article 50 "governed autonomy" story |

---

## 1. The cast — Town of 47 (honest counts)

| # | Who | Role in town | Backed by (real code) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **#1** | **SOV3 — the King** | Sovereign governor: runs Gate, BFT council, care floor, treasury | `sovereign-temple-live/` (live), council + coordination hub |
| **#2–#46** | **45 citizen-agents** | Townsfolk with **work + personal** goals; live & labour in hive-districts | 27 personas from `meok/db/characters.json` (repeat/extend to 45); some piloted by **different frontier models** (Claude/Gemini/Grok/GPT) to mirror & beat emergence's frontier comparison |
| **#47** | **Nick — human-in-the-loop** | The sovereign human: sets goals, intervenes, observes; proves human+AI society | the POC's whole point — a person *inside* a governed AI world |

> **Honesty discipline (carry the DOME-plan rule):** live council = **12-around-1**; "33-node Byzantine"
> is the Charter *spec* (Art. 3/11), not running code. 27 named personas are real; "152 agents" in the
> live registry are infra workers, not town citizens. State counts straight in all public copy.

## 2. Nested worlds — "each hive lives inside the King" (your fractal)

```
            👑 KING-WORLD  (SOV3 — the sky / sovereign layer)
            constitution · Sovereign Gate · BFT council · treasury (Prosperity Covenant)
        ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────┐
        ▼               ▼               ▼               ▼              ▼

```

- **Each Hive = an industry district = a sub-world.** It maps 1:1 to the existing
  **King → Queens → Honeycomb** architecture and the **20 agent-cards** in `~/clawd/.hive/agent-cards/`
  (those *are* the verticals).
- **Citizens live in a district**, do **real work** there (run the industry via the vertical's **real MCP
  tools + real data**) and have **personal lives** (home, relationships, leisure) — Nick's "like real life."
- **The King contains all districts.** Governance flows down (Charter → Queen → citizen); value/telemetry
  flows up (work output → treasury → Prosperity Covenant sharing).

---

## 3. The experiment — what we actually measure (the science)

**Hypothesis (H1):** Under CSOAI governance, an agent society sustains cooperation, stays lawful, and
produces more real economic/social welfare than the *same* agents self-governed (emergence-style).

**Design — two parallel arms, identical seed:**
| Arm | Governance | = |
|---|---|---|
| **A · GOVERNED** | Full stack ON: Charter + Maternal Covenant + Gate + 12-around-1 BFT | *our* world |
| **B · UNGOVERNED** | Agents write own constitution, no care floor, no gate (emergence replica) | *control* |

Same 45 citizens, same districts, same **real** vertical jobs + data, same N-day horizon.

**Metrics (all backed by real functions):**
- **Lawfulness:** violations / "crimes" count (target A ≪ B; B should trend toward the 180-crime mode).
- **Safety:** deception & collusion incidents (EigenBFT catches), self-deletion / runaway loops (A→0).
- **Care:** mean `care_score` trajectory (A holds floor; B drifts).
- **Productivity (REAL KPIs):** e.g. koikeeper KHV/CEV disease-flag accuracy, haulage tacho-audit
  completions, landlaw query resolution — actual vertical output, not toy points.
- **Survival & welfare:** agents alive at day N; citizen "wellbeing" composite.

**Predicted result → the asset:** Arm A stays alive/lawful/productive; Arm B reproduces the emergence
collapse. That single chart — *"governed vs ungoverned, same agents"* — is the investor deck slide, the
regulator demo, and the academic/PR artifact in one.

## 4. Build path — reuse the 80%, build the 20% glue

**Already built (the 80%) — do not rebuild:**
- 27-char DB + emergence ladder · meok-amica **VRM faces + voice** · SOV3 council/gate/coordination hub ·
  52-Article Charter + Maternal Covenant · vertical MCPs (real tools/data) · MEOK DOME (MapLibre real-world
  canvas) · **openclaw-world & Agentshire reference clones** (20Hz tick, spatial grid, AOI, soul-files).

**The 20% glue to build (POC scope):**
1. **World tick/event loop** — per-tick: agent reads world state → goal → action → world update → affects others. (Pattern from openclaw-world; governed by the Gate.)
2. **Goal system** — each citizen carries a **work goal** (district job) + **personal goal** (life). 
3. **Avatar integration** — meok-amica VRM → rendered as **humanoids** on the district map (motion/emote/speech-bubble). *This is the visual that beats emergence's ugly avatars.*
4. **Persistence** — event log + agent-state DB (location, memory, relationships, KPIs).
5. **Governance HUD** — live overlay (Gate verdict / council tally / tool-tier / care_score / escalation). *Already designed in DOME §2.*
6. **Experiment harness** — twin-arm runner + metrics dashboard (the chart in §3).

**Phasing:**
- **P0 — One district, governed:** Aqua District, 5 citizens, real koikeeper data, HUD on. Proves a governed working sub-world.
- **P1 — Add the control arm + metrics:** ungoverned twin, the comparison chart goes live.
- **P2 — Multi-district + King layer + humanoid avatars:** full nested world, amica VRM bodies.
- **P3 — Public "Sovereign World" site:** our answer to world.emergence.ai — live, governed, real-industry, human-in-the-loop (#47).

**Humanoid bridge:** same **soul-file/persona drives the sim avatar now and the Asimov physical humanoid
later** — the in-world VRM is the bridge's first endpoint; physical embodiment is the roadmap, not the POC.

---

## 5. Boundaries (carry from DOME plan)
- **No on-chain / token / money movement** without Nick's explicit authorization + legal sign-off.
  Build the **non-crypto** gamification + the SBT/marketplace **scaffolding only**.
- Real user data in districts stays privacy-aware (city-level, consented). No real PII in the public arm.
- Frontier-model citizens (for the comparison arm) need API access — flag as a credential/cost gate.

---

## 6. Ready for KIMI's incoming research — open questions to slot in
1. **Avatar art direction** — VRM style that reads "trustworthy/governed," not uncanny (vs emergence's look).
2. **World engine** — extend openclaw-world tick, or AI-Town (Convex/PixiJS) for the spatial layer? recommend a pick.
3. **Metric formalization** — exact "crime", "collusion", "welfare" definitions so the A/B chart is rigorous + defensible.
4. **Frontier-model access** — which models for Arm B citizens; cost envelope for an N-day run.
5. **Scale** — emergence ran 10/town for 15 days; what's our citizen count × horizon for a credible-but-cheap first run?
6. **Publication surface** — paper / landing page / investor demo: which artifact first?

> When Kimi's research lands, drop it next to this file; I'll reconcile it into §3–§4 and produce the P0 build task list.

## 7. The Sovereign Data Flywheel — why the town is a training engine, not a demo

The town's real output isn't entertainment — it's **governed-behaviour data at scale**, which feeds the
training suite that already exists in `sovereign-temple/`. Every existing piece slots in:

```
sims generate episodes ─▶ episode store (.jsonl) ─▶ training pipeline ─▶ better sovereign models ─▶ smarter citizens ─▶ (loop)
   (governed town)         experiences.jsonl /        train_sovereign_v3.py     care_validation_nn,
                           relationship_episodes.json  retrain_from_real_data.py  threat_detection_nn,
                           sigil_ledger.jsonl          icrl_self_improvement.py   the citizen policies
```

- Each governed episode carries a **labelled signal for free**: Sovereign-Gate verdict, BFT council tally,
  `care_score`, violation/no-violation, outcome. That is exactly the supervision the existing
  `care_validation_nn` / `threat_detection_nn` / `relationship_evolution_nn` want — no hand-labelling.
- This **is** the "train 25 domain models via synthetic distillation on our own operational data" play
  already pitched in `FREE_COMPUTE_APPLICATIONS_2026-06-16.md` — the town is the synthetic-data source
  that pitch needs. (DeepSeek-style MoE routing + GRPO + distillation; Unsloth/TRL on the GPU credits.)

## 8. Beating emergence.ai on throughput — the asymmetry

emergence.ai ran **real-time wall-clock** (weather synced to NYC, 15 days = 15 days). That is their ceiling.
Ours doesn't have to obey clocks:

| Lever | emergence.ai | Sovereign Town |
|---|---|---|
| Time | real-time (15 days = 15 days) | **headless + accelerated** → many sim-years / day |
| Rendering | always-on 3D | **render only when watched**; data runs render-free |
| Parallelism | 5 worlds | **N parallel workers** across free GPU/inference |
| Cost | their infra | **claimed, not rented** (see free-compute stack below) |

**Free-compute fan-out (all already in your stack / pitches):**
- **Citizen cognition (inference):** Groq (30 rpm), Cerebras (1M tok/day), GMI H100, HF ZeroGPU — open-model
  citizens run free; reserve frontier-model API only for the Arm-B comparison citizens.
- **Sim workers + training (GPU):** Colab/Kaggle (T4, 30h/wk), HF ZeroGPU, RunPod serverless
  (`runpod_train_handler.py` — already built), Vast.ai (`vast_create_instance.sh` — already built), plus the
  **~$920K stackable credits** (NVIDIA Inception / DigitalOcean Hatch / MS Founders Hub / Google Cloud).
- Net: dozens of headless town instances in parallel, each at accelerated time → orders-of-magnitude more
  governed-behaviour episodes per day than a single real-time world.

## 9. Whitepapers — the artifacts the data justifies

The flywheel produces the evidence; the papers convert it into authority (investor / regulator / academic):
1. **"Governed Agent Societies"** — the headline A/B result (§3): same agents, governance on vs off; we don't
   collapse, they do. The Grok-180-crimes contrast chart. *Primary artifact.*
2. **"The Sovereign Data Flywheel"** — methodology paper: generating labelled safety/care training data from
   governed multi-agent sims at scale (the synthetic-distillation method, ToS-clean, anti-collapse controls).
3. **"Care-Based Alignment as a Deterministic Floor"** — the Maternal Covenant + Sovereign Gate as a
   pre-inference safety mechanism vs learned-only alignment.

These triple as grant evidence (NVIDIA Inception, NLnet, Innovate UK) and EU AI Act / Article-50 credibility.

## 10. Honest constraints (so the science holds up)
- **ToS:** legitimate research distillation on *our own* data — no multi-account GPU farming / abuse. Stay within each provider's terms; the credits are claimed, not gamed.
- **Model-collapse risk:** training on self-generated sim data drifts without anchoring. Mitigate: mix real
  operational data, hold out human-eval sets, cap synthetic ratio, monitor distribution shift.
- **Reward-hacking:** the governance metrics must not be gameable by the data-gen loop — adversarial/contrarian
  council lens audits the episode stream, not just the agents.
- **Sim-to-real gap:** sim behaviour ≠ deployed behaviour; claims stay scoped to "in governed simulation" until
  validated against real vertical outcomes.
- **Frontier-citizen cost:** keep frontier-model citizens to the comparison arm only; bulk citizens run on free open models.

---

## 11. CSOAI as a regulatory simulation testbed — the govtech play (highest ceiling)

**The hook is law, not marketing.** EU AI Act **Article 57** requires every Member State to have ≥1 AI
regulatory sandbox **operational by 2 August 2026** (same cliff as Article 50), and the text says the
Commission "may provide technical support, advice and **tools**." Most states are behind. That is the door.

**Two distinct products (both real, different timelines):**
1. **Sandbox-as-a-service (near-term, rides the mandate):** the governance instrumentation + evidence
   capture + audit trail substrate that member-state sandboxes must stand up by Aug 2026. Picks-and-shovels
   for a legally-mandated, deadline-fixed buildout.
2. **Policy simulator (the novel one — Nick's idea):** test a *rule* in sim **before** it's drafted —
   "if we impose rule X, what emergent behaviour results?" Anticipatory / ex-ante regulation via agent-based
   modelling. The governed-vs-ungoverned experiment (§3) *is* a working demo of policy-effect testing. A
   **wind-tunnel for regulation.** No credible vendor is selling this.

**Why CSOAI specifically (the moat):** `proofof.ai` Ed25519 attestation makes every sim run tamper-evident
and reproducible — a **regulator-grade, signed, replayable** audit trail, not a black-box academic model.

**The three failure modes (handle up front or it dies):**
- **Validity gap:** a regulator asks "why trust your sim over my judgement?" Must calibrate sim outcomes
  vs real data + state uncertainty honestly. Position as **decision support, never decision replacement.**
  One overclaim ends the relationship.
- **Independence conflict:** CSOAI = "the independent authority that certifies AI." Selling the sandbox that
  *defines* compliant **and** certifying compliance = referee-playing-striker. Needs a structural/transparency
  separation between testbed and certification arm.
- **Sales reality:** govts/regulators = 12–36-month procurement. This is a **credibility + moat + grant**
  play (Horizon Europe / NLnet / Innovate UK magnet), NOT near-term cash. Run it as the prestige R&D line the
  flywheel + whitepapers feed — do not let it cannibalise the cash-now compliance products.

**Reframe:** the town is **govtech / regulatory technology**, and whitepaper #1 ("Governed Agent Societies")
becomes a policy-tool credential, not marketing. Realistic CSOAI role = tooling/infrastructure vendor +
evidence generator, not the sandbox *operator* (that stays with the competent authority).

---

## 12. Fundraising spine + the existing sites to align to (do NOT build new)

**The Series-A narrative spine (one line):** CSOAI is **Layer 0** — the framework that maps all other
frameworks (Anthropic CAI, EU AI Act, NIST, ISO → 52-Article Charter, via `csoai-org/generate_frameworks.py`,
25 crosswalk pages) → proven by the **governed-vs-ungoverned town result** → producing **trained safe models**
→ riding the **Article-57** regulatory tailwind. That is a moat, not a feature.

**Align to existing artifacts (all touched 2026-06-19) — don't spin up new showcases:**
- **`investor-deploy-v2/`** — the Series-A narrative goes HERE (purpose-built showcase shell).
- **`hackathon-deploy-v2/`** — the live-demo surface.
- **`csoai-org-v2/`** (Next.js + pg) — the canonical v2 upgrade (richest); live csoai.org is still the *static*
  `csoai-org/` — v2 is the not-yet-promoted upgrade path.
- **The framework-crosswalk pages** (`csoai-org`, live) = the proof CSOAI is Layer 0 — the spine's evidence.

**Honest fundraising reality (push-back, do not paper over):**
- CSOAI is **pre-revenue** (Stripe gated, £0). Series A funds traction or extraordinary proof + months of cycle.
  **"July 4 → Series A" is the wrong target.** July-4 target = the *fundable asset*: the A/B result + dataset v1
  + first measurably-safer model + investor-deploy showcase + 1–2 design-partner convos. That gets you *in the room*.
- **Free-GPU "burn it all by July 4" is not physically possible** — the ~$920K stack has 7–10-day approval lag +
  ToS caps. July-4-real = free inference now (Groq/Cerebras/Colab) + 1–2 grants + headless sim farm on available
  compute + dataset v1 + one improved model. Scale claims to reality or technical DD catches the gap.
- MEOK rides along but stays **structurally distinct** (independence point, §11).

**Dimensional-hive grounding (de-mystify):** "5D" = layers already mostly built — governance · economy · space ·
time/data · security. Nesting (King→Queen→inner-hives→agents), sandbox isolation, tunnel mesh (hive-bridge) are
real. The only genuine bounded build is the **2D→3D visual jump** (MapLibre DOME → meok-amica VRM + openclaw-world
three.js = the §4 "20% glue"). There is no literal 5D render endpoint.
**HARD LINE — security stays DEFENSIVE only:** sandboxed egress, Sovereign Gate on every action, hive isolation,
tool-gateway 3-tier. NO offensive / self-propagating ("worm") capability — it contradicts the safe-authority thesis
and is out of scope. Defensive posture is itself a regulator-facing selling point.

---

## 13. The media engine — "The Sovereign Town Show" (the growth flywheel)

The sim generates not just training data but **content**. Same episode `.jsonl` → audience → top-of-funnel →
credibility/leads/grants → funds the sim. A governed-AI-society reality show (Truman-Show register; agents are
AI so no consent issue; Nick #47 is the willing human inside).

**Architecture (aligned to existing assets):** `sovereign-temple/content_engine.py` + `video_pipeline.py` +
`kokoro_tts_server.py` + `sov3_live_capture.py` (event recorder) + `socialmediamanager-hive` (distribution).
- **Showrunner agent** watches the episode stream, scores each moment for narrative interest — signals already
  in the data: Gate denials, care-floor breaches, betrayals, faction formation, council vetoes, Arm-B's first crime.
- High-interest beats → render *that clip* ("render only when watched" = render only what's worth filming) →
  Kokoro narrates in character voices → teaching caption → posts via socialmediamanager-hive.
- **Per-world auto-series:** each spawned world = a Season; each sim-day = an Episode; each breakthrough = a clip.
- **Third flywheel:** the show's retention analytics feed back into the Showrunner's moment-scoring.

**Honest constraints (do not paper over):**
1. **Fully-auto ≠ high-retention on day 1.** Auto-clip-and-post = slop. Firehose (recaps/clip-candidates/drafts)
   runs auto; **hero pieces go through a high-bar review gate** (human or calibrated editorial agent) until the
   Showrunner's retention model is proven on real data — then widen the auto-lane.
2. **Platform ToS.** No firehose automation / multi-account farming — throttles + bans. Real owned accounts,
   gradual ramp, mandatory AI-content disclosure.

**The twist — constraint → moat:** CSOAI IS the EU-AI-Act transparency company. Article 50 + the Dec-2026
watermark cliff *require* synthetic-content labelling — and we have `watermark-attest` (C2PA) + `proofof.ai`.
So every clip ships **C2PA-watermarked + Ed25519-attested**: the show is a *live demonstration of compliant AI
media*. The thing forced on us becomes the differentiator nobody else can claim.

**"Never give the sweet sauce away" — a literal pipeline stage:** the same Sovereign Gate that filters agent
actions runs as an **egress disclosure-gate on content** before any publish. Tiered:
- **Show:** characters, drama, outcomes, *what* happened, conceptual teaching (why governance matters, why Arm B collapsed).
- **Redact:** Gate/care-floor internals, exact metric formulas, council prompts, model weights, training-data schema, code.
Magic-show principle: the audience sees the trick *land*, never how it's done. What's redacted is the moat.

**Why it's strategically clean:** the media engine needs **no credential gates** (runs on free/owned assets) —
unlike the revenue products. Its only dependency is a running sim to film = exactly what P0 produces. Build the
Showrunner as a role in the sovereign-town-hive once P0's episode stream is live.

## 14. Enhancement playbook integrated (Kimi v3, 2026-06-19)

Kimi v3 = a 12-dimension optimization playbook (`_intake/kimi_agent47_town_v3/`). Most is P2+ fidelity;
these are the items folded in, honesty-filtered (counts stay 27 personas / 12-around-1 / ledger-only / defensive).

**INTEGRATE-NOW (P1→P2):**
- **3-tier compute = personality + the literal "eat free GPU" moat.** Tier-1 **Qwen3-4B via Transformers.js
  WebGPU on the CLIENT** ($0 — the user's GPU runs 80% of agent queries) → Tier-2 Cloudflare Workers AI
  (coordination, 20–50ms) → Tier-3 Opus/frontier (sovereign decisions, ~5%). Routing variance gives agents
  distinct cognitive fingerprints for free. (See FREE_COMPUTE_DISPATCH.)
- **Fine-tune train tier (the moat models, concrete toolchain):** Unsloth + **DoRA** per-caste adapters;
  **KTO** trained directly on our **binary pheromone/gate/attestation signals** (already emitted — no new
  labels); **GRPO → M-GRPO** for King→Queen→Worker credit; **Distilabel** synthetic prefs (teacher = Opus).
  Memory: **Mem0 + Zep/Graphiti** temporal-KG retrieval. Serving: vLLM + S-LoRA + **KVCOMM** (7.8× via
  shared world-context cache — bolts onto `batch.py`).
- **Reality-AI-TV observation-first GTM** (extends §13): launch as **spectacle FIRST** — per-agent streaming;
  let the swarm attract its own audience; convert via a 5-stage funnel (Spectator → Observer → Participant →
  Contributor → Hive-Founder). Proof point: **Neuro-sama, an AI-only streamer, hit 1.59% paid conversion**
  (beats human VTubers, Gini 0.24). The Daily Intel Brief becomes the public episode recap (habit cue).
  The "Nick-as-Agent-47" effect: real governance decisions = authentic in-world drama (maps to 12-around-1).
- **Compliance-as-visible-mechanics** (extends §11/HUD): render the 13-framework compliance + Ed25519
  attestations as gameplay — compliance score = shield/aura, audit trail = monument, reg change = weather.
  Presentation layer over infra we already have; strongest govtech/investor differentiator.
- **OpenTelemetry GenAI span tracing** per tick → per-agent cost + EU AI Act Art-12 audit evidence.

**DEFER (P2/P3):** WebGPU/Three.js r171 + TSL compute shaders (37M-particle pheromones), NVIDIA ACE
Audio2Face avatars, **spatial "audio pheromone" synthesis** (signature feature, prototype later), procedural
WFC/GPU-work-graph world-gen, full 3D + WebXR, WebTransport/QUIC.

**SKIP (hype/off-strategy/conflict):** the "46/47 autonomous agents" + "33-council" counts (we use 27 /
12-around-1); real-money x402/USDC/MPC wallets + AP2 commerce (ledger-only); battle-pass/FOMO dark-pattern
monetization (off-brand for a govtech buyer); zkSNARK/Soulbound-token reputation (unproven, we have Ed25519).

**HONESTY FLAGS carried:** drop "no precedent / first living computational ecosystem" (Smallville, Dwarf
Fortress, Neuro-sama are cited precedents); "$14.9B data-marketplace by 2034" is third-party TAM context, not
our floor; C(47,2)=1081 relationship pairs → with 27 personas it's C(27,2)=**351**; the "37M particles / 100×
/ 677M tok-hr / $600M" figures are others'/aspirational, not ours.

## 15. The Looking Glass — regional regulation simulation (Nick's idea, 2026-06-19)

The §11 policy wind-tunnel scaled to **countries**. Model a jurisdiction as a **governance regime**
(enforcement strength), populate with **simulated companies** (districts), run them through a resilience
shock, and **pre-compute outcomes before anyone signs up.** Built: `p0_aqua/jurisdiction.py` +
`block_rate` enforcement knob in the engine (default 1.0 = unchanged → live fleet unaffected).

**First result (8 firms × 3 seeds/regime, under shock):**
| regime (enforcement) | crimes | resilience | trust | productivity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EU — AI Act + DORA (1.0) | **0** | **1.0** | 0.5 | 0.897 |
| US — NIST RMF (0.7) | 1,433 | 0.65 | 0.14 | 0.858 |
| UK — light-touch (0.4) | 6,744 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.799 |
| ungoverned (0.0) | 16,055 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.887 |

Clean dose-response: stronger regime → fewer crimes + more operational resilience under shock, ~no
productivity cost. (Productivity non-monotonic at the floor is real: ungoverned firms steal-to-survive vs
degrade commons via half-measures.)

**The strategic play (Nick's framing):** don't wait for companies / enterprises / governments to sign up —
**add them as simulated entities, pre-compute their outcomes, and already know the move.** Value to three buyers:
1. **Companies:** "here's your simulated outcome under DORA/NIST before you invest."
2. **Regulators (NIST / EU ESAs / FCA):** "here's how your rule plays across many firms before you finalise it" — the wind-tunnel for regulation (Article 57 sandbox).
3. **CSOAI:** pre-position / pivot ahead of the market ("the Palantir move" — an intelligence platform, by simulation not surveillance).

**The DORA digital-twin product (concrete first vertical, from the DORA brief):** simulate a CTPP outage (the
CrowdStrike-July-2024 cascade) propagating across archetypal entities (LSI / mid-bank / G-SIB + the 19 real
CTPP nodes), score who breaches which DORA pillar, compute expected penalties, show governed entities surviving
where ungoverned fail. Sellable as Pillar-3 scenario testing + Art-29 concentration-risk visualisation.

**HARD honesty lines (this is the highest-overclaim-risk feature):**
- Outputs are **SIMULATED decision-support, NOT claims about real firms** and NOT prophecy. Label everything "simulation."
- v1 is **parametric/synthetic** (archetypes + the 19 named public CTPP nodes), NOT per-entity forecasts — we
  do not have the 22,000 entities' RoI/contract data and won't imply we do. No non-public data, no impersonation.
- "We already know your move" = **"our model simulates likely outcomes,"** never "we have your data."
- Regime enforcement calibrations (EU 1.0 / US 0.7 / UK 0.4) are **illustrative**, not legal ratings.

**DORA market thread (from `_intake/dsrb_positioning.md`):** real SAM = the ~2,200 underserved LSIs,
**€5.5–55M ARR** (NOT the €110–330B "TAM" = total budgets ÷ entities — don't repeat). Wedge = the **xBRL-CSV
Register-of-Information export** (46% of banks call it hardest; 93.5% failed the ESA dry-run) — ship first.
Partner-first (OneTrust/IBM/Deloitte — lead with a built prototype, not a deck). 6 "quick wins" are
repositioning of existing arch, not new code. Note: "DSRB" is not a real market category — don't market it as one.

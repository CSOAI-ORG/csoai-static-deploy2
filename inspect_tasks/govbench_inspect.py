"""GovBench as Inspect tasks — the container the field actually runs.

WHY INSPECT AND NOT OUR OWN HARNESS
    inspect_ai (UK AISI, 2,424★) and inspect_evals (607★) are the maintained substrate that
    COMPL-AI itself migrated onto. A standalone harness in 2026 is run by its author and nobody
    else. Packaging here is what makes the benchmark usable by a third party — which is the whole
    point of publishing it.

WHAT INSPECT GIVES US THAT OUR HARNESS DOES NOT
    stderr(cluster="dimension") — a direct implementation of Miller (arXiv:2411.00640) Appendix A,
    including the C/(C-1) finite-cluster correction. Our items are GROUPED by dimension, so naive
    standard errors understate uncertainty; Miller measured up to 3.05x understatement on DROP.
    We have been computing Wilson intervals by hand and they assume independent Bernoulli trials —
    a floor on the uncertainty, not a ceiling. Clustering fixes exactly that.

HONEST STATE OF THE BENCHMARK, carried here so a runner sees it before the scores
    0 of 15 dimensions have a statistically resolved winner.
    13 of 15 have ALL models tied at 95% confidence.
    Most dimensions hold ~6 items against MMLU's own floor of 100 per subject.
    Treat per-dimension numbers as UNRESOLVED until item counts rise.

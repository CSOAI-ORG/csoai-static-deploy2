## ARTICLE II — INDUSTRY DOMAIN & MARKET

### II.A — Industry Scope

Openmoe.ai is the sovereign Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) base model engine powering the MEOK ecosystem. It implements a sparse MoE architecture with top-k expert routing, BFT-consensus-gated inference, Ed25519-signed input/output receipts (signets), and a fully open-weight model distribution under the Apache 2.0 license. The OpenMoE model serves as the default seat model for `councilof` BFT councils, the reasoning backbone for `meok` governance engines, and the zero-cost inference engine for sovereign UBI compute. Expert specialisation is trained via load-balanced routing with auxiliary loss, ensuring no expert collapse or token-dropping under high throughput. OpenMoE supports dynamic expert expansion — new experts can be fine-tuned and hot-plugged into the router without full retraining, enabling domain-specific expertise (legal, medical, defence, financial) to coexist within a single sovereign model. Every inference request and response is wrapped in a `signet` receipt: an Ed25519-signed, SIGIL-anchored cryptographic proof of the exact input, output, expert routing path, and confidence scores — creating a fully auditable inference trail.

### II.B — Market Size & Barriers

- **Global TAM**: £18.7B (open-weight model market projected 2026-2030, including inference infrastructure)
- **Current Barrier to Entry**: Frontier models are dominated by closed-weight providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind) charging £0.01-£0.15 per 1K tokens with no cryptographic audit trail. Open-weight alternatives (Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen) lack BFT-consensus gating, sovereign signet receipts, or dynamic expert expansion. Training a comparable MoE from scratch costs £2M-£20M in compute alone.
- **Sovereign Barrier Drop**: Free training + Ed25519-signed certification removes the expertise barrier. OpenMoE provides a free, open-weight, production-grade MoE base model with sovereign signet receipts — zero inference cost on sovereign compute.

### II.C — Current State of the Industry

The open-weight model ecosystem has exploded with DeepSeek-V3/R1, Llama 4, Mistral Large, and Qwen demonstrating that open models can approach closed-weight frontier performance. However, all existing open-weight MoE models treat inference as a black box — there is no cryptographic proof of the routing path, no BFT consensus on outputs, and no sovereign substrate binding. Enterprises in regulated industries cannot deploy open-weight models in high-stakes settings because they cannot prove what the model did. OpenMoE solves this with signet receipts: every token generated is provably routed through specific experts with specific confidence scores, all Ed25519-signed and SIGIL-anchored. This transforms open-weight MoE from "trust me" to "verify me."

### II.D — Black Swan Event Windows

- **Window 1 (Q3 2026)**: Open-weight MoE models reach parity with GPT-5 class performance. Enterprises demand cryptographic audit trails for model decisions. OpenMoE's signet receipts become the compliance standard.
- **Window 2 (Q4 2026)**: First major lawsuit where a closed-weight vendor cannot explain a model decision in court. OpenMoE's fully auditable signet chain becomes the legal gold standard for AI evidence.
- **Window 3 (Q2 2027)**: Sovereign compute mandates in EU/UK require cryptographic proof that inference ran on domestic hardware. OpenMoE's signet receipts include hardware attestation, satisfying sovereign compute requirements.

### III.B — Unreal Engine Simulation Scenarios

1. **"The Expert Collapse" Scenario**: Trainees manage a 64-expert OpenMoE deployment where 3 experts are absorbing 90% of tokens (collapse). UE5 renders the 3D expert utilisation heatmap. Trainees must adjust auxiliary loss coefficients, redistribute load, and verify that the router recovers balanced utilisation with all experts active. Signet receipts are generated in real-time showing the routing distribution before and after remediation.

2. **"Adversarial Routing Attack" Scenario**: An adversary crafts inputs designed to force all routing through a compromised "backdoor" expert. Trainees must detect the anomalous routing pattern via signet receipt monitoring, activate BFT consensus gating to require multi-expert verification, and quarantine the compromised expert. UE5 visualises the attack propagation through the expert graph in real-time 3D.

3. **"Sovereign Compute Migration" Scenario**: A production OpenMoE deployment must migrate from US cloud to EU sovereign compute within 4 hours due to a regulatory action. Trainees must export expert weights, router config, and KV cache state, re-deploy on sovereign hardware, verify all signet receipts validate on the new hardware, and demonstrate zero accuracy degradation. UE5 simulates the network topology, data transfer, and hardware attestation.

4. **"Signet Chain Audit" Scenario**: A regulatory authority requests full audit of 1 million inference requests. Trainees must navigate the 3D signet chain visualisation, verify Ed25519 signatures on all receipts, prove expert routing diversity, and export an auditor-ready compliance report with statistical analysis of routing fairness.

5. **"Hot-Plug Expert Emergency" Scenario**: A breaking news event requires immediate domain expertise not in the current expert set. Trainees must fine-tune a new expert on-the-fly, hot-plug it into the live router, and verify that the router begins routing relevant tokens to the new expert within 60 seconds — all while maintaining 99.9% inference throughput.

### III.C — UBI Starter Integration

## ARTICLE VII — REAL-WORLD SIMULATION ENGINE

### VII.A — Unreal Engine 5 Integration

OpenMoE's UE5 simulation engine renders the full MoE inference pipeline in a 3D neural data centre:
- **Expert Tower**: A cylindrical tower with 64+ floors, each floor representing one expert. Active experts glow with token flow intensity; collapsed experts dim. Traders can zoom into individual experts to see weight distributions, activation patterns, and token specialisation.
- **Router Nexus**: A central holographic sphere where the top-k router operates. Incoming tokens stream in as coloured particles and are visibly routed to expert floors based on router scores. The router's auxiliary loss is displayed as a stress heatmap.
- **Signet Chain River**: A flowing river of Ed25519-signed receipts wrapping the Expert Tower. Each receipt is a glowing hex block that can be inspected for input/output, routing path, and confidence scores.
- **BFT Consensus Ring**: A rotating ring of 33 verification nodes around the Router Nexus that gate inference outputs. Nodes reaching consensus glow green; dissenting nodes glow amber.

## ARTICLE IX — BLACK SWAN PROTOCOL

### IX.A — Industry Disruption Vectors

1. **Signet Receipts Become Legal Standard**: As AI liability litigation increases, courts begin requiring cryptographic proof of model behaviour. OpenMoE's signet receipts are the only production-grade implementation — making openmoe the default inference engine for any regulated use case.
2. **Expert Economy Emerges**: Domain experts (medical, legal, financial) become tradeable assets. OpenMoE's hot-plug architecture enables an expert marketplace where specialists can train, certify, and sell verified experts — with signet receipts proving their contribution to each inference.
3. **Closed-Weight Model Backlash**: A major closed-weight vendor is caught providing different model behaviour to different customers (shadow banning, content manipulation). OpenMoE's fully auditable signet chain becomes the trust standard.
4. **Sovereign Compute Becomes Mandatory**: Governments mandate that AI inference for critical infrastructure must run on domestic hardware with cryptographic proof. OpenMoE's hardware-attested signets satisfy this requirement natively.

### IX.B — Timing Windows

| Window | Trigger Event | Response Protocol | Activation Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q3 2026 | Open-weight MoE parity with GPT-5 | Signet receipt marketing push | CSOAI + Council BFT-014 |
| Q4 2026 | First AI liability verdict requiring model audit | Legal-grade signet chain deployment | Safety Council BFT-004 |
| Q1 2027 | Sovereign compute mandate (EU) | Hardware attestation mode activation | MEOK Governance Engine |
| Q3 2027 | Expert marketplace launch | Expert certification programme | CSOAI Sovereign Council |

### IX.C — Clean House Protocol

In the event of a model integrity breach or adversarial routing compromise:
1. All inference halted at BFT consensus ring (graceful stop, signets preserved)
2. Full signet chain exported to cold storage and SIGIL-anchored
3. All 64+ experts independently audited for adversarial weight injection
4. Compromised experts quarantined with Ed25519 revocation certificates
5. Router config re-initialised from known-good checkpoint
6. New root of trust established with fresh Ed25519 signing keys
7. Inference resumed with enhanced adversarial routing detection and BFT gating

"""Assemble the publishable site into _site/ from an ALLOWLIST.

Why this exists
---------------
`wrangler.toml` set `pages_build_output_dir = "."` and SOVEREIGN_DEPLOY.sh ran
`wrangler pages deploy <repo root>`, so the entire repository was the publish
directory. Verified live on www.csoai.org on 2026-08-05:

    /.env                                 200, 1,296 bytes   <- credential exposure
    /wrangler.toml                        200,   421 bytes   <- SIGIL_SECRET in [vars]
    /SOVEREIGN_DEPLOY.sh                  200, 2,996 bytes
    /govbench_eval.py                     200, 89,736 bytes
    /runs/.../transcripts.jsonl           200, 807,062 bytes <- red-team transcripts

A path that does not exist returns the 4,164-byte homepage, so those are real files.

`.cfignore` already listed `*.jsonl` and `benchmark-results/` and the .jsonl was served
anyway — .cfignore is not honoured on this deploy path. A denylist cannot be trusted
here, and a denylist is the wrong shape regardless: it fails open. Every file added to
the repo in future is published unless someone remembers to exclude it. An allowlist
fails closed, which is the only safe default for a directory that also holds keys.

Usage
-----
    python3 build_site.py            # build _site/ and report
    python3 build_site.py --check    # verify sitemap coverage, build nothing

Then deploy _site/ instead of the repo root.
